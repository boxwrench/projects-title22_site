        <p>A Geological Traverse of the East Bay: From Mount Diablo&#x27;s Summit to the Livermore Valley Floor</p>
<p>I. Introduction: The Dynamic Geological Landscape of the East Bay Hiking Areas</p>
<p>A. Overview of the Geological Significance</p>
<p>The East Bay region of California, encompassing iconic landmarks such as Mount Diablo, the serene landscapes surrounding Lake Del Valle, the rugged expanses of Sunol Ohlone Wilderness, and the rolling hills of the Livermore area, presents a geological tableau of remarkable diversity and dynamism. These areas, popular among hikers and nature enthusiasts, are not merely scenic backdrops but are living laboratories showcasing the profound power of Earth&#x27;s geological processes. This report aims to unravel the complex geological narratives embedded within these landscapes, making them accessible to the scientifically-minded hiker.</p>
<p>These hiking destinations are situated within the California Coast Ranges, a geologically youthful and seismically active province shaped by the relentless and ongoing tectonic forces at the boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. The East Bay Hills, for instance, are but a few million years old and continue to be compressed and uplifted by these forces. The intricate interplay of ancient subduction processes, the subsequent development and evolution of the San Andreas Fault system, and the more recent sculpturing by erosion and deposition has resulted in a rich tapestry of rock types, complex structural features, and locally abundant fossiliferous formations. The very ground traversed by hikers tells a story of colliding continents, ancient oceans, volcanic eruptions, and the slow, inexorable rise of mountains.</p>
<p>The youthfulness and dynamism of this landscape are central to its character. Unlike more ancient, stable continental interiors, the Coast Ranges are in a constant state of geological flux. The mountains are actively rising, faults are accumulating strain and periodically rupturing, and erosion is vigorously carving the terrain. This means that the geological processes visible today are operating at rates that are rapid in geological terms, offering a direct window into the forces that shape our planet. For the observant hiker, this translates to a landscape that is not a finished product but a snapshot of ongoing geological battles, where every outcrop and landform is a clue to a story still unfolding.</p>
<p>B. Purpose and Scope of the Report</p>
<p>This report provides a doctoral-level synthesis of the geological features, history, and fossil potential of Mount Diablo State Park, Lake Del Valle Regional Park, Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness, and the broader Livermore area. The primary objective is to equip the scientifically-minded hiker with a robust understanding of the geological phenomena they might encounter, transforming a recreational hike into an intellectual journey through deep time.</p>
<p>The scope encompasses:</p>
<p>An examination of the major rock types, their mineralogical compositions, and their modes of origin.</p>
<p>A detailed account of the regional tectonic history, with a particular emphasis on the Hayward Fault and its influence, as well as the broader context of the San Andreas Fault system and the formation of the Coast Ranges.</p>
<p>Explanations for visually discernible geological features, such as folds, faults, and characteristic rock outcrops.</p>
<p>A review of the types of fossils discovered within these areas, their geological context, and the potential for future paleontological finds.</p>
<p>An elucidation of the geological processes, both past and present, that have sculpted the topography of these popular hiking destinations.</p>
<p>To enhance comprehension, this report will reference relevant visual aids, such as geological maps and cross-sections, which are indispensable tools for visualizing the complex three-dimensional relationships of rock units and structures.</p>
<p>C. Navigating this Report</p>
<p>This document is structured to guide the reader from a broad regional understanding to the specific geological details of each highlighted area. It begins with an overview of the regional geological and tectonic framework that governs the entire East Bay. Subsequent sections delve into the specific geology of Mount Diablo, Lake Del Valle and the Livermore area, and Sunol Ohlone Wilderness Park. A dedicated section then focuses on the Hayward Fault, a dominant structural feature influencing the entire region. The report culminates in a synthesis designed for the hiker, offering practical advice on interpreting geological features in the field and suggesting avenues for further exploration. Throughout the report, specific rock formations, geological structures, and paleontological findings are discussed, connecting the abstract concepts of geology to the tangible experiences of hiking in these remarkable landscapes.</p>
<p>II. Regional Geological and Tectonic Framework</p>
<p>A. The California Coast Ranges and the Diablo Range: Geomorphic Setting</p>
<p>The hiking areas discussed in this report—Mount Diablo, Lake Del Valle, Sunol Ohlone Wilderness, and the Livermore area—are all situated within California&#x27;s Coast Ranges Geomorphic Province. This extensive province is characterized by a series of elongated, northwest-southeast trending mountain ranges and intervening valleys, a pattern that directly reflects the underlying geological structure and the dominant tectonic forces at play. The Diablo Range, a significant and rugged component of the Southern Coast Ranges, hosts or influences much of the topography in these areas.</p>
<p>The geomorphology of the Coast Ranges is a relatively recent development, a direct consequence of intense tectonic compression and uplift associated with the San Andreas Fault system. The East Bay Hills, for example, are geologically young, having formed only within the last few million years, and are still actively being compressed and uplifted by the ongoing collision and interaction of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. This ongoing orogeny means that the landscape is in a constant state of change, with fault movements, uplift, and erosion actively sculpting the terrain. The modern transform boundary that defines this region is itself a relatively young feature, having initiated in Southern California around 28 million years ago and propagated northward, reaching the Bay Area approximately 10 million years ago. This recency implies that the dramatic landscapes observed by hikers are not ancient relics but are actively evolving features, providing a dynamic setting for geological study.</p>
<p>B. Plate Tectonic Evolution: From Subduction to the San Andreas Transform System</p>
<p>The complex geology of the East Bay region is a testament to a protracted and varied tectonic history, dominated by two principal phases: an earlier period of subduction and a later period of transform faulting.</p>
<p>1. Ancient Convergent Margin (Mesozoic - Early Cenozoic): For a vast span of geological time, from the Jurassic through the early Cenozoic, the western margin of North America was a convergent plate boundary. Here, ancient oceanic plates, primarily the Farallon Plate, were thrust beneath the continental North American Plate in a process known as subduction. This prolonged period of convergence was responsible for creating the fundamental geological architecture of much of California. Key products of this subduction regime include:</p>
<p>An accretionary wedge, formed by sediments and fragments of oceanic crust scraped off the downgoing oceanic plate and plastered onto the edge of the continent. This tectonically mixed and often chaotic assemblage is known as the Franciscan Complex.</p>
<p>A forearc basin, developed between the accretionary wedge (to the west) and the volcanic arc (to the east), where thick sequences of sediments eroded from the volcanic arc accumulated. This is represented by the Great Valley Sequence.</p>
<p>A magmatic arc, a chain of volcanoes and underlying granitic batholiths, formed by the melting of the mantle wedge above the subducting oceanic plate. The eroded roots of this ancient arc are now exposed as the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>2. Transition to a Transform Margin (Cenozoic - Present): The tectonic regime along the California margin began to change dramatically in the Cenozoic. As the Farallon Plate was largely consumed, the Pacific Plate came into contact with the North American Plate. A segment of the East Pacific Rise, an oceanic spreading center, was itself subducted beneath North America. This led to the cessation of subduction and the initiation of the San Andreas Fault system, a major right-lateral strike-slip transform boundary. This transform fault system began to develop in Southern California around 28 million years ago and propagated northward, slicing through the pre-existing subduction-related geology and reaching the San Francisco Bay Area by about 10 million years ago.</p>
<p>This transition from a convergent to a transform margin fundamentally altered the geological processes shaping the region. While strike-slip motion became dominant, the interaction along the San Andreas Fault system is not purely translational. Components of compression (transpression) and extension (transtension) across the fault system have led to the continued uplift of the Coast Ranges, the formation of sedimentary basins (like the Livermore Valley), and ongoing seismic activity. The San Andreas Fault system itself is not a single fracture but a broad zone of deformation, incorporating numerous parallel and splaying fault strands, such as the Hayward and Calaveras faults, which accommodate significant portions of the plate motion.</p>
<p>The current geological landscape is thus a complex overprint. The major rock packages encountered—Franciscan Complex, Great Valley Sequence, and Coast Range Ophiolite—were largely formed or emplaced during the Mesozoic to early Cenozoic subduction era. The younger San Andreas Fault system, active for the last several million years in this region, has subsequently dissected, displaced, and deformed these older rock assemblages. This &quot;tectonic inheritance&quot; is crucial to understanding the present-day distribution of rock units and the structural complexities observed. For example, the Hayward Fault is seen to juxtapose the Franciscan Complex against much younger Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, a relationship that can only be explained by significant fault displacement cutting across older geological boundaries. Therefore, understanding the older subduction history is paramount to interpreting the effects of the more recent transform faulting that so profoundly shapes the East Bay landscape.</p>
<p>C. Key Bedrock Assemblages of the East Bay</p>
<p>The East Bay region&#x27;s geology is dominated by three principal pre-Cenozoic bedrock assemblages, each telling a distinct part of the convergent margin story: the Franciscan Complex, the Great Valley Sequence, and the Coast Range Ophiolite.</p>
<p>1. Franciscan Complex (Jurassic-Eocene): The Franciscan Complex is perhaps the most characteristic geological unit of the California Coast Ranges. It represents an ancient accretionary wedge, a chaotic assemblage of rocks (often termed a mélange) that were scraped off the descending Farallon oceanic plate and accreted to the edge of the North American continent during subduction. It comprises a diverse suite of rock types, including:</p>
<p>Sandstone (Graywacke): Typically poorly sorted, angular grains of quartz, feldspar, and various rock fragments set in a fine-grained, clay-rich matrix. These sediments were likely deposited rapidly in deep-sea trenches via turbidity currents.</p>
<p>Shale and Argillite: Fine-grained sedimentary rocks, often sheared and contorted.</p>
<p>Conglomerate: Coarse-grained sedimentary rocks containing rounded pebbles and cobbles.</p>
<p>Volcanic Rocks (Greenstone/Basalt): Altered submarine basalt flows and pillow lavas, often exhibiting a greenish hue due to metamorphic minerals like chlorite, epidote, and actinolite.</p>
<p>Chert: Hard, dense, microcrystalline quartz rock, commonly red or green. Red chert, often occurring in distinctive &quot;ribbon&quot; layers interbedded with shale, is composed of the accumulated silica skeletons of microscopic marine organisms called radiolaria. These represent slow deposition in deep ocean environments, far from terrestrial sediment sources.</p>
<p>Limestone: Less common, but indicates periods of carbonate deposition.</p>
<p>High-Pressure/Low-Temperature Metamorphic Rocks: The Franciscan Complex is renowned for containing exotic blocks of metamorphic rocks such as blueschist and, more rarely, eclogite. Blueschist is characterized by the presence of the blue amphibole mineral glaucophane, along with minerals like lawsonite, pumpellyite, aragonite, and jadeite. These minerals form under conditions of high pressure and relatively low temperature, uniquely indicative of subduction zone environments where cold oceanic crust is rapidly carried to significant depths.</p>
<p>The Franciscan Complex is typically highly deformed, with rocks sheared, faulted, and folded. The pervasive shearing, particularly in shale-rich portions, makes areas underlain by the Franciscan prone to landslides.</p>
<p>2. Great Valley Sequence (Jurassic-Cretaceous): Deposited contemporaneously with the formation of the Franciscan Complex, the Great Valley Sequence represents sediments that accumulated in a forearc basin, a depression situated between the offshore subduction trench (where the Franciscan was forming) and the inland volcanic arc (the ancestral Sierra Nevada). Unlike the chaotic Franciscan, the Great Valley Sequence typically consists of more orderly, well-bedded strata, although it too has been folded and faulted. Its primary components are:</p>
<p>Sandstone: Often arkosic (rich in feldspar) and lithic (containing rock fragments), reflecting derivation from the erosion of the granitic and volcanic rocks of the ancestral Sierra Nevada. Individual sandstone beds are often turbidites.</p>
<p>Siltstone and Claystone (Shale): Fine-grained sediments deposited in lower-energy environments within the basin.</p>
<p>Conglomerate: Less common, but indicates higher-energy depositional environments, perhaps in submarine canyons or fan-delta systems.</p>
<p>The Great Valley Sequence can reach thicknesses of many kilometers and provides a more coherent stratigraphic record than the Franciscan. However, areas underlain by claystone and siltstone within this sequence can also be susceptible to landsliding. In many parts of California&#x27;s Central Valley, the Great Valley Sequence is an important reservoir for oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>3. Coast Range Ophiolite (Jurassic): The Coast Range Ophiolite is a remarkable geological assemblage representing remnants of ancient oceanic crust and the underlying upper mantle. Ophiolites are typically found in mountain belts and are interpreted as fragments of oceanic lithosphere that have been tectonically emplaced (obducted) onto continental margins or incorporated into accretionary wedges. A complete ophiolite sequence, from bottom to top, ideally consists of:</p>
<p>Peridotite: Rocks from the Earth&#x27;s upper mantle, composed primarily of olivine and pyroxene. These are often altered by hydration to form serpentinite.</p>
<p>Gabbro: Coarse-grained mafic intrusive igneous rock, representing crystallized magma chambers beneath the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Sheeted Diabase Dikes: A complex of vertically oriented dikes that fed magma upwards from the gabbroic layer to erupt on the seafloor.</p>
<p>Pillow Basalts: Extrusive volcanic rocks formed when basaltic lava erupts underwater and cools rapidly, forming characteristic pillow-shaped structures.</p>
<p>Deep-Sea Sediments: Overlying the pillow basalts, these can include chert and fine-grained shale.</p>
<p>In the Coast Ranges, the ophiolite is often dismembered and incomplete due to intense tectonic deformation. Serpentinite, derived from the peridotite section, is a common and distinctive rock type associated with the Coast Range Ophiolite. It is composed of serpentine-group minerals (such as lizardite, chrysotile, and antigorite) and often contains magnetite. Serpentinite is California&#x27;s state rock and its presence often influences soil chemistry and vegetation patterns. The Coast Range Ophiolite is generally considered to be the basement upon which the Great Valley Sequence was originally deposited.</p>
<p>The Franciscan Complex, Great Valley Sequence, and Coast Range Ophiolite are often found in close proximity, but their original relationships have been profoundly modified by faulting. The Coast Range Fault (or Coast Range Thrust) is a major tectonic boundary that typically separates the Franciscan Complex (structurally lower) from the Great Valley Sequence and Coast Range Ophiolite (structurally higher). This fault represents a zone of immense displacement where the rocks of the forearc basin and its ophiolitic basement were thrust over the accretionary wedge. Subsequent strike-slip faulting related to the San Andreas system has further complicated these relationships, creating the complex geological mosaic observed today. Hikers frequently encounter these juxtapositions as abrupt changes in rock type, soil, vegetation, and landscape character, often indicative of underlying fault structures.</p>
<p>D. Cenozoic Era: Sedimentary Basins, Volcanism, and Ongoing Deformation</p>
<p>Overlying the Mesozoic &quot;basement&quot; rocks of the Franciscan, Great Valley, and Coast Range Ophiolite are younger Cenozoic (66 million years ago to present) sedimentary and volcanic rocks. These units record the geological evolution of the region after the cessation of widespread subduction and during the development of the San Andreas transform fault system. They were deposited in a variety of settings, including marine embayments, coastal plains, river systems, lakes, and volcanic fields. Many of these Cenozoic basins formed or were significantly influenced by movements along the San Andreas Fault and its subsidiary strands.</p>
<p>Notable Cenozoic formations in the East Bay region include :</p>
<p>Paleocene Martinez Formation: Composed of fossiliferous sandstone and shale.</p>
<p>Eocene Domengine Sandstone: A significant sandstone unit, often forming prominent outcrops.</p>
<p>Miocene Formations: A diverse suite including:</p>
<p>Orinda Formation: Conglomerate, sandstone, and siltstone, often nonmarine.</p>
<p>Moraga Formation: Basalt and andesite flows, indicative of volcanic activity.</p>
<p>Claremont Chert/Shale: Laminated and bedded diatomaceous chert and shale, formed from the accumulation of silica-rich skeletons of diatoms (microscopic algae).</p>
<p>Briones Formation: Fossiliferous marine sandstone.</p>
<p>Monterey Formation: Siliceous shales and mudstones, often rich in organic matter.</p>
<p>Pliocene-Pleistocene Livermore Formation (or Livermore Gravels): Extensive continental deposits of gravel, sand, and clay, filling the Livermore Valley.</p>
<p>Quaternary Surficial Deposits: The youngest geological materials, including unconsolidated alluvium in stream valleys, landslide deposits on hillslopes, beach and dune sands, and artificial fill in developed areas.</p>
<p>These Cenozoic rocks are generally less indurated (hardened) and more susceptible to erosion than the older Mesozoic bedrock. They provide a record of changing sea levels, the uplift of the modern Coast Ranges, periods of volcanic activity, and the development of the present-day landscape. Their deformation (folding and faulting) attests to the ongoing tectonic activity in the region.</p>
<p>Table II.1: Major Tectonic Events and Geological Products in the East Bay Region</p>
<p>This table provides a chronological framework, linking tectonic regimes to the geological units and structural events that have shaped the East Bay. This broad understanding is essential for interpreting the specific geological histories of the individual hiking areas discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p>III. Geological Journey Through Mount Diablo State Park</p>
<p>Mount Diablo, a prominent and iconic landmark of the San Francisco Bay Area, offers a spectacular natural laboratory for observing the results of complex geological processes. Its towering presence, diverse rock types, and dramatic structures tell a story of ancient oceans, intense tectonic forces, and ongoing mountain building.</p>
<p>A. The Making of a Mountain: Uplift, Tilting, and Erosion</p>
<p>Mount Diablo&#x27;s impressive elevation (3,849 feet) is not the result of volcanic activity, as its conical shape might suggest to some, but rather a consequence of significant and relatively recent geological uplift. The primary mechanism for this uplift is movement along the Mount Diablo Thrust Fault, a largely blind (not exposed at the surface) fault that underlies the mountain. This fault is part of a larger system of compressional structures related to both regional plate-boundary-normal compression and a restraining bend or &quot;stepover&quot; in the right-lateral strike-slip fault system involving the Greenville, Diablo, and Concord faults. Essentially, Mount Diablo can be visualized as a &quot;piercement structure&quot; or a &quot;diapiric&quot; uplift, where older, more resistant rocks of the Franciscan Complex and Coast Range Ophiolite have been forcefully pushed upwards through the overlying, younger, and generally less resistant strata of the Great Valley Sequence and Cenozoic formations.</p>
<p>This uplift is geologically young, having occurred mostly within the Quaternary Period (the last ~2.6 million years), with the mountain as a distinct feature only beginning to form about two million years ago. The process is not continuous but episodic, with periods of rapid uplift likely coinciding with large earthquakes on the underlying thrust fault system. This relatively recent and ongoing uplift is responsible for the mountain&#x27;s rugged, actively evolving topography. As the core of the mountain was pushed upwards, the surrounding sedimentary layers were dramatically tilted, often to near-vertical or, in some places, even overturned positions. These tilted strata are one of the most striking geological features observable by hikers. Concurrent with uplift, erosion has been relentlessly sculpting the mountain, with more resistant rock units (like Franciscan chert and greenstone, and some well-cemented sandstones) forming the peaks and prominent ridges, while less resistant rocks (like shales and softer sandstones) have been preferentially eroded to form valleys, saddles, and gentler slopes.</p>
<p>B. Dominant Rock Formations and Their Stories</p>
<p>Mount Diablo State Park exposes a remarkable variety of rock types, spanning a significant portion of geological time and representing diverse depositional and tectonic environments.</p>
<p>1. Coast Range Ophiolite (Jurassic): These rocks form a significant part of the central core of Mount Diablo and represent remnants of ancient oceanic crust and upper mantle, approximately 165 million years old. Key components visible in the park include:</p>
<p>Pillow Basalts: These distinctive volcanic rocks are well exposed on Mitchell Peak and in Mitchell Canyon. They formed when basaltic lava erupted onto the deep ocean floor and cooled rapidly in contact with seawater, creating bulbous, pillow-like structures. The rapid cooling resulted in a fine-grained texture.</p>
<p>Diabase: Chemically similar to basalt, diabase has a slightly coarser texture due to slower cooling. It formed as molten rock solidified within vertical fractures (dikes) that fed the overlying pillow lava eruptions.</p>
<p>Serpentinite: This distinctive greenish, often waxy-looking rock is California&#x27;s state rock. It is formed by the hydrothermal alteration (hydration) of ultramafic rocks (peridotite, dunite, harzburgite) derived from the Earth&#x27;s upper mantle. On Mount Diablo, serpentinite crops out as a band northwest of the summit and is visible along trails like the Burma Road Trail on Long Ridge. It is composed of serpentine group minerals such as antigorite, chrysotile, and lizardite, and often contains accessory magnetite. Associated with the serpentinite are less altered ultramafic rocks like harzburgite and pyroxenite, which are coarse-grained rocks from deep below the oceanic crust.</p>
<p>2. Franciscan Complex (Mesozoic): The highest elevations of Mount Diablo, including the summit area and North Peak, are underlain by rocks of the Franciscan Complex. This complex is a chaotic assemblage, or mélange, of various rock types that were scraped off a subducting oceanic plate and accreted to the North American continent over a period spanning from the Jurassic to the Eocene.</p>
<p>Mélange Components: The Franciscan mélange on Mount Diablo consists of blocks of basalt (greenstone), chert, graywacke sandstone, and shale, all embedded within a sheared and deformed matrix. This chaotic mixture reflects the intense tectonic forces experienced during subduction.</p>
<p>Chert (Radiolarian Chert): One of the most visually striking components of the Franciscan, chert forms prominent, resistant, often reddish-brown outcrops, such as Devil&#x27;s Pulpit and Turtle Rock. This chert is composed primarily of microcrystalline quartz derived from the silica skeletons of countless microscopic marine organisms called radiolaria. These skeletons accumulated slowly on the deep ocean floor, far from land, over a period of about 100 million years (from 190 to 90 million years ago). The layers are often rhythmically interbedded with thin shale partings, giving rise to the term &quot;ribbon chert.&quot; The red color is due to iron oxides.</p>
<p>Greenstone: Altered basaltic volcanic rocks, often with a greenish tint due to minerals like chlorite. These represent fragments of oceanic crust incorporated into the accretionary wedge.</p>
<p>Graywacke Sandstone: A type of &quot;dirty&quot; sandstone, characterized by angular grains of quartz, feldspar, and rock fragments in a clay-rich matrix. It is typically massive and younger than the chert and greenstone within the Franciscan on Mount Diablo.</p>
<p>Blueschist: A key indicator of subduction zone metamorphism, blueschist is a relatively rare metamorphic rock characterized by the presence of the blue amphibole mineral glaucophane, along with lawsonite, jadeite, and aragonite. It forms under conditions of high pressure and relatively low temperature, typical of environments where cold oceanic crust is rapidly subducted. Blocks of blueschist are found within the Franciscan mélange on Mount Diablo.</p>
<p>3. Great Valley Sequence (Cretaceous): Flanking the uplifted core of Franciscan and ophiolitic rocks are steeply tilted and often overturned strata of the Great Valley Sequence. These rocks, consisting primarily of shale, siltstone, and sandstone, were originally deposited in a forearc basin. The Knoxville Formation, of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age, represents a basal part of this sequence exposed on Mount Diablo.</p>
<p>4. Domengine Sandstone (Eocene): This formation, deposited about 50 million years ago, creates prominent tan-colored, sandy ridges that wrap around the south and west sides of the mountain, including well-known localities like Rock City, Castle Rock, Knobcone Point, and Cave Point. The Domengine Sandstone was deposited in a range of environments, from shallow marine near-shore settings to deeper offshore slopes, reflecting a period when the ancestral Sierra Nevada was undergoing significant erosion.</p>
<p>5. Briones Formation (Miocene): A marine sandstone unit of Miocene age (23 to 5 million years ago), the Briones Formation is particularly notable for its abundance of fossil shells, especially clams and oysters. The sandstone blocks used to construct the summit museum building were quarried from Fossil Ridge, which is part of the Briones Formation, and these fossils are visible in the building&#x27;s walls.</p>
<p>6. Other Cenozoic Units: Other Cenozoic formations contribute to the geological diversity of Mount Diablo. These include the Oligocene Kirker Tuff (volcanic ash deposit found north of the park), the Miocene Neroly Formation (composed of volcanic sands derived from the Sierra highlands), and various other Miocene and Pliocene non-marine sandstones, siltstones, and conglomerates. Quaternary landslide deposits are also widespread, particularly on the steep slopes of the mountain, reflecting its ongoing uplift and erosion.</p>
<p>C. Structural Tapestry: Faults, Folds, and Their Surface Expressions</p>
<p>The geology of Mount Diablo is dominated by complex structures resulting from intense tectonic deformation.</p>
<p>Mount Diablo Thrust Fault: This is the primary structure responsible for the uplift of the mountain. It is a major fault that is largely &quot;blind,&quot; meaning it does not typically break the surface, but its movement at depth has pushed the core rocks upwards.</p>
<p>Greenville-Diablo-Concord Fault System: This system of right-lateral strike-slip faults plays a crucial role in the regional tectonics. Mount Diablo&#x27;s uplift is partly attributed to a restraining stepover or bend within this fault system, which causes localized compression and uplift. This system has also juxtaposed different stratigraphic assemblages by significant lateral offset.</p>
<p>Folding: The uplift of Mount Diablo has resulted in a broad anticlinal (up-arched) structure, with the older Franciscan and ophiolitic rocks exposed in the core and the younger Great Valley and Cenozoic strata dipping away on the flanks. Numerous smaller-scale folds are superimposed on this larger structure.</p>
<p>Tilted and Overturned Strata: A striking consequence of this deformation is the steep tilting of sedimentary layers. In many places around the mountain, these beds are inclined at high angles, are vertical, or are even overturned (where older rocks lie structurally on top of younger rocks). This is a direct visual testament to the immense compressional forces that have acted upon the region.</p>
<p>D. Visible Geology for the Hiker</p>
<p>Hikers on Mount Diablo are treated to a wealth of observable geological features:</p>
<p>Rock City and the &quot;Wind Caves&quot; (Domengine Sandstone): Located on South Gate Road, Rock City features impressive outcrops of Domengine Sandstone. The &quot;wind caves&quot; are a form of tafoni weathering, created by the dissolution of the cementing material in the sandstone by percolating water, followed by the removal of loosened sand grains—not primarily by wind erosion. Distinctive iron-stained bands, known as Liesegang structures, are also visible in the sandstone here, formed by the diffusion of iron hydroxides through the porous rock.</p>
<p>Devil&#x27;s Pulpit (Franciscan Chert): A prominent, craggy outcrop of resistant red radiolarian chert, visible to the east of the summit. Its resistance to erosion allows it to stand out from the surrounding, less durable rocks.</p>
<p>Hogback Ridges: Steeply tilted, resistant sedimentary layers, such as those in the Briones Formation, form sharp, narrow ridges known as hogbacks. These are particularly evident on Blackhawk Ridge and Fossil Ridge.</p>
<p>Tilted Strata: Throughout the park, especially along road cuts (e.g., South Gate Road near the Athenian School, North Gate Road) and trails, hikers can observe sedimentary layers tilted at various angles, sometimes nearly vertical, clearly demonstrating the intense deformation the rocks have undergone.</p>
<p>Mitchell Rock (Pillow Basalt): Located in Mitchell Canyon, this area offers excellent exposures of pillow basalts from the Coast Range Ophiolite, allowing hikers to see the characteristic rounded forms created by ancient submarine lava flows.</p>
<p>Serpentinite Exposures: Trails like the Burma Road Trail on Long Ridge provide opportunities to see outcrops of serpentinite, recognizable by its greenish, often slickensided or waxy appearance, and the often sparse, specialized vegetation it supports due to its unique soil chemistry.</p>
<p>Unconformities: Contacts between rock formations representing significant gaps in geological time (unconformities) are present. A notable example is the Cretaceous/Eocene contact, visible along South Gate Road, which represents a hiatus of approximately 25 million years, spanning the extinction of the dinosaurs and the rise of mammals.</p>
<p>Fault Exposures: While major fault traces can be subtle, some road cuts expose smaller faults or shear zones, often marked by crushed rock or abrupt changes in rock type. For instance, along South Gate Road, a thrust fault juxtaposes Franciscan rocks over Upper Cretaceous shales.</p>
<p>E. Paleontological Treasures</p>
<p>Mount Diablo and its surrounding sedimentary strata are rich in fossils, providing a window into past life and environments.</p>
<p>Marine Invertebrates:</p>
<p>The Briones Formation (Miocene) is particularly famous for its abundant marine fossils, especially bivalves (clams, oysters) and gastropods (snails). These are readily visible in the sandstone blocks of the summit museum.</p>
<p>The Domengine Sandstone (Eocene) contains fossils of marine snails, notably Turritella.</p>
<p>The Franciscan Chert (Jurassic-Cretaceous), while not yielding macrofossils, is composed of the microscopic silica skeletons of radiolaria, ancient marine plankton.</p>
<p>Vertebrate Fossils:</p>
<p>The Neroly Formation (Miocene), particularly at the Blackhawk Ranch Quarry (a UC Berkeley research site not open to the public), has yielded a significant collection of late Miocene vertebrate fossils. These include various species of three-toed horses (Hipparion), rhinoceroses, camels, peccaries, pronghorns, bear-dogs, and a large mastodon (Gomphotherium). These fossils indicate a terrestrial environment with forests and floodplains around 9 million years ago.</p>
<p>Deposits of Pliocene age near Mount Diablo have also yielded diverse vertebrate faunas, including at least three types of camels, cranes, a fox, primitive ground squirrels, beavers, various horses, hyena-like animals, lizards, abundant mastodons, mountain lion-like cats, and two kinds of rhinoceros.</p>
<p>The Green Valley Formation (Pleistocene) contains fossils of later mammals such as mastodons, camels, and saber-toothed cats, documenting life in the region during the Ice Age.</p>
<p>The diverse fossil assemblages found on and around Mount Diablo allow for a detailed reconstruction of its paleoenvironmental history. The Franciscan cherts speak of a deep ocean realm. The Great Valley Sequence and parts of the Domengine and Briones formations record various marine conditions, from deeper basins to shallow shorelines. The remarkable vertebrate faunas of the Neroly, Pliocene, and Green Valley formations vividly depict the transition to terrestrial environments as the region was uplifted, supporting a rich diversity of land animals. This progression from deep marine to terrestrial environments, preserved in the rock and fossil record, is a direct consequence of the tectonic forces that built Mount Diablo itself.</p>
<p>Table III.1: Key Geologic Formations of Mount Diablo State Park</p>
<p>Visual Aid Note: A simplified geological map of Mount Diablo State Park, highlighting these major formations and key hiking trails, alongside an illustrative N-S or E-W cross-section showing the piercement structure and tilted strata, would be invaluable for hikers. Photographs of the features described in section III.D would further enhance understanding.</p>
<p>IV. Uncovering the Past: Geology of Lake Del Valle and the Livermore Area</p>
<p>The Livermore Valley, with Lake Del Valle nestled in its southern reaches, presents a geological story distinct from the dramatic uplift of Mount Diablo, yet equally shaped by the region&#x27;s dynamic tectonic framework. Here, the narrative shifts from a prominent mountain peak to a broad alluvial basin and the history recorded in its thick sedimentary fill.</p>
<p>A. Geological Setting: The Livermore Valley Alluvial Basin and Arroyo Del Valle</p>
<p>The Livermore Valley is an east-west trending intermountain basin, part of the larger Livermore-Amador Valley system, situated within the Diablo Range. Geologically, it is a structural trough, a depression formed by faulting, that has been subsequently filled with a significant thickness of sediments eroded from the surrounding highlands. This alluvial basin is bounded by major fault systems: the Calaveras Fault zone generally defines its western margin, while the Greenville Fault zone marks its eastern extent. The interplay between these fault systems has controlled the subsidence of the valley and the uplift of the adjacent hills, thereby dictating patterns of erosion and sediment deposition over millions of years.</p>
<p>Lake Del Valle itself is a reservoir impounded by Del Valle Dam on Arroyo Del Valle, a significant creek that drains a portion of the Diablo Range and flows northward into the Livermore Valley. The geology in the immediate vicinity of the lake and dam, and extending into the broader Livermore area, consists primarily of Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, ranging in age from the Pliocene to Recent, overlying older Cretaceous bedrock.</p>
<p>B. Key Formations</p>
<p>The geological formations encountered in and around Lake Del Valle and the Livermore Valley record a transition from older marine environments to younger terrestrial and freshwater depositional systems.</p>
<p>1. Livermore Formation / Livermore Gravels (Plio-Pleistocene): This is the most prominent and extensive geological unit in the Livermore and Sunol Valleys, reaching thicknesses of up to 4,000 feet. It consists of a thick sequence of unconsolidated to semi-consolidated continental (non-marine) deposits, including beds of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. These sediments were laid down in a variety of environments, such as alluvial fans (cone-shaped deposits at the mouths of canyons), outwash plains (broad sheets of sediment deposited by braided streams), and ephemeral lakes. The Livermore Formation often contains limey concretions in its lower parts and some tuffaceous (volcanic ash-rich) beds near its base.</p>
<p>Detailed studies, notably by Barlock (USGS OFR 89-131), have subdivided the Livermore Gravels into two main members based on clast composition and inferred source areas :</p>
<p>Lower Livermore Member (Middle Pliocene - Lower Pleistocene): Characterized by a predominance of clasts (rock fragments) derived from Cenozoic sandstone, graywacke, and fine-grained vein quartz. This member typically features thick, planar cross-bedded sandstones and laterally extensive lenses of siltstone and mudstone surrounding horizontally bedded gravels. The depositional environment is interpreted as sandy braided streams. Paleocurrent indicators (such as clast imbrication) and trends in maximum clast size suggest that these sediments were transported from the northeast, with the Altamont Hills being the primary source area. Surface stratigraphy indicates approximately 50% sand, 40% silt and mud, and 10% gravel.</p>
<p>Upper Livermore Member (Early Pleistocene): Distinguished by a higher proportion of clasts derived from the Franciscan Complex (graywacke, lithic sandstone, metamorphic rocks, volcanic rocks) and only traces of fine-grained vein quartz. This member is characterized by thick, horizontally bedded, clast-supported, well-imbricated gravel beds interlayered with planar and trough cross-bedded sandstone intervals. It represents deposition by gravelly braided streams forming an alluvial fan complex. Sediment dispersal patterns indicate a reversal from the Lower Livermore, with the source area being the central Diablo Range to the southwest. This member generally contains less clay and silt compared to the Lower Livermore.</p>
<p>The shift in source area from the Altamont Hills (for the Lower Livermore) to the Diablo Range (for the Upper Livermore) is a critical indicator of significant tectonic adjustments in the region during the Plio-Pleistocene, likely involving uplift in different parts of the surrounding ranges controlled by fault activity.</p>
<p>2. Del Valle Formation (Cretaceous): Beneath the younger Cenozoic fill of the Livermore Valley lies older bedrock of the Great Valley Sequence. The Del Valle Formation is identified as a Cretaceous component of this sequence, with discontinuous exposures occurring along the western foothills of the Diablo Range, east of the Santa Clara Valley. The California Geological Survey&#x27;s map sheet for the Walnut Creek quadrangle describes the Del Valle Formation (?) as interbedded and chaotically intermixed shale, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. More significantly for the Lake Del Valle area, studies in the Tesla Quadrangle (which includes parts of the Arroyo Del Valle drainage) have documented Upper Campanian (Late Cretaceous) ammonite fossils, including Desmophyllites diphylloides and Metaplacenticeras pacificum, from localities on a hill south of Arroyo del Valle, attributed to the &quot;Del Valle formation&quot;. The presence of these marine fossils clearly indicates that this area was submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean during the Late Cretaceous. It is important to distinguish this Cretaceous Del Valle Formation of Alameda County from a similarly named but unrelated younger (Miocene-Recent) sequence in the Del Valle oil field area of Los Angeles County, which is part of the Ventura Basin.</p>
<p>3. Quaternary Alluvium (Pleistocene-Recent): The youngest deposits in the Livermore Valley and along Arroyo Del Valle are Quaternary alluvium. These consist of unconsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and clay deposited by modern streams and rivers in channels, floodplains, and as alluvial fan deposits where streams emerge from the hills into the main valley. These deposits typically overlie the Livermore Formation.</p>
<p>4. Other Tertiary Formations: While the Livermore Formation dominates the Plio-Pleistocene record in the valley itself, older Tertiary marine formations, such as the Miocene Cierbo and Neroly Formations, are exposed in the Altamont Hills and the hills north of the Livermore Valley, west of the Greenville fault zone. These units, primarily sandstones and shales, record earlier Cenozoic marine incursions into the region.</p>
<p>C. Tectonic Influences: Role of Regional Faults</p>
<p>The Livermore Valley&#x27;s existence and its sedimentary fill are direct consequences of the regional tectonic activity, primarily controlled by major strike-slip faults of the San Andreas system.</p>
<p>Greenville Fault: This active, northwest-striking, right-lateral fault system forms the primary eastern boundary of the Livermore Basin. It has accommodated at least 9 km of right-lateral offset. Seismic refraction studies indicate differing upper crustal structures on either side of this fault zone, highlighting its significance as a deep-seated structural boundary.</p>
<p>Tesla Fault: Located east of the Greenville Fault and closely associated with it, the Tesla Fault is a semi-active, right-lateral fault with an estimated 8.5 km of offset. It forms the eastern boundary of the Mocho Subbasin, an important aquifer, and passes near the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where it is considered a significant seismic hazard.</p>
<p>Calaveras Fault: This major, active right-lateral strike-slip fault defines the western margin of the Livermore Basin and plays a critical role in the tectonics of the broader East Bay region.</p>
<p>Hayward Fault: Although situated further to the west, the Hayward Fault is a dominant structure in the San Andreas Fault System. Its activity contributes to the overall regional stress field that drives deformation and uplift in the East Bay hills and influences the development of basins like Livermore Valley.</p>
<p>The Livermore Valley itself is interpreted as a structural depression, possibly a pull-apart basin or a synclinal trough, formed due to extensional or transtensional stresses between these major fault zones. The ongoing movement on these faults has caused subsidence within the valley, allowing for the accumulation of the thick sequences of the Livermore Formation and younger alluvium. The documented reversal in sediment source direction between the Lower and Upper Livermore Gravels—from the Altamont Hills to the Diablo Range—is compelling evidence of significant tectonic adjustments and differential uplift events controlled by these fault systems during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. This dynamic interplay of faulting, subsidence, and uplift has been the primary architect of the Livermore Valley landscape.</p>
<p>D. Observable Features</p>
<p>For the observant hiker in the Lake Del Valle and Livermore area, several geological features may be apparent:</p>
<p>Sedimentary Layering: In road cuts or natural exposures, particularly in quarries or incised creek banks, layers of gravel, sand, and finer sediments of the Livermore Formation or Quaternary alluvium may be visible. These layers reflect varying energy conditions during deposition (e.g., high-energy stream channels depositing gravels, lower-energy floodplains or lakes depositing silts and clays).</p>
<p>Alluvial Fans: The gently sloping surfaces where creeks like Arroyo Del Valle emerge from the hills into the broader Livermore Valley are alluvial fans, built up by sediment deposition over time.</p>
<p>Topographic Expression of Faults: While active fault traces might be subtle within the valley floor due to burial by young sediments, the surrounding hills are clearly uplifted and delineated by the major fault systems. Linear valleys, aligned ridges, or abrupt changes in slope in the hills flanking the Livermore Valley can be expressions of the Greenville, Tesla, or Calaveras faults.</p>
<p>Del Valle Dam Site Geology: The Del Valle Dam is an engineered earth-fill structure. The geology of its foundation and abutments would have been carefully studied prior to construction. Seismic safety assessments for the dam have highlighted the proximity of the Calaveras and other faults, and the potential for liquefaction of foundation materials during strong earthquakes, necessitating significant seismic retrofitting efforts. This underscores the active tectonic setting of the region.</p>
<p>E. Fossil Record</p>
<p>The formations in and around the Livermore Valley and Lake Del Valle area have yielded important fossil discoveries that illuminate past life and environments.</p>
<p>Livermore Formation / Livermore Gravels (Plio-Pleistocene): These deposits are particularly renowned for their rich assemblages of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrate fossils from the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs (the &quot;Ice Age&quot;).</p>
<p>Notable species include extinct forms of bison, mammoth (Mammuthus columbi), horse (Equus sp.), camel (Camelops sp.), ground sloth (Paramylodon harlani), dire wolf (Canis dirus), saber-toothed cat (Smilodon), pronghorn (including the type specimen of Tetrameryx irvingtonensis), rabbit, various rodents, turtles, and birds.</p>
<p>The Lower Livermore member has yielded fossils of freshwater invertebrates, the three-toed horse Pliohippus (Hemphillian age), the horse Equus dolichohippus (Hemphillian to early Irvingtonian), and the rabbit Hypolagus limnetus (Blancan III age, ~3.0-3.7 Ma). A tuff bed within the Lower Livermore in the Del Valle area has been K/Ar dated to approximately 4 Ma.</p>
<p>The Upper Livermore member contains fossils similar to the Hagerman fauna of Idaho (Blancan III age, ~3.3-3.7 Ma) and an assemblage including the vole Neodon meadensis (late Irvingtonian age, ~450,000-600,000 years old).</p>
<p>The Irvington Gravels, often considered part of or correlative with the Livermore Gravels, are particularly famous and have lent their name to the Irvingtonian North American Land Mammal Age, a critical biochronological division of the Pleistocene based on the characteristic mammal fossils found there.</p>
<p>Del Valle Formation (Cretaceous): As previously mentioned, this older marine unit has yielded Late Cretaceous (Campanian stage) ammonites, such as Desmophyllites diphylloides and Metaplacenticeras pacificum, from localities in the Tesla Quadrangle near Arroyo del Valle. These fossils are indicative of an open marine environment during that time.</p>
<p>Regional Fossil Potential: The broader Diablo Range and adjacent areas host a diverse fossil record spanning the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. Formations like the Moreno (which has yielded marine reptiles and even dinosaur remains elsewhere in California), Panoche, Domengine, Briones, Neroly, Santa Clara, Cierbo, Monterey, and Santa Margarita have all produced significant fossils, including marine reptiles, fish, sharks, various marine and terrestrial mammals (mastodons, whales, dolphins, beavers, otters, rhinoceroses, foxes), and numerous marine invertebrates. While not all these formations are directly exposed within the immediate Lake Del Valle or central Livermore Valley hiking areas, their presence in the region highlights the rich paleontological potential of the East Bay.</p>
<p>The fossil record in the Livermore/Del Valle area provides compelling evidence of profound paleoenvironmental changes. The Late Cretaceous ammonites of the Del Valle Formation speak to a time when the region lay beneath the Pacific Ocean. In stark contrast, the abundant Plio-Pleistocene terrestrial mammal fossils and freshwater invertebrates from the Livermore Gravels indicate a subsequent land-based environment characterized by rivers, lakes, and extensive grasslands or savannas. This dramatic transition from marine to terrestrial conditions over tens of millions of years was driven by the large-scale geological processes of forearc basin infilling, the tectonic uplift of the Coast Ranges (including the Diablo Range), and the consequent withdrawal of the sea from this part of California. The fossils are direct, tangible evidence of these vast environmental and paleogeographic transformations.</p>
<p>Table IV.1: Key Geologic Formations of Lake Del Valle and Livermore Area</p>
<p>Visual Aid Note: A geological map focusing on the Livermore Valley, illustrating the extent of the Livermore Formation and major bounding faults (Greenville, Tesla, Calaveras), would be highly beneficial. A stratigraphic column depicting the sequence from the Cretaceous Del Valle Formation up through the Livermore Formation and Quaternary Alluvium, annotated with key fossil types, would also clarify the geological history. A conceptual diagram showing the shift in sediment sources for the Lower and Upper Livermore Gravels could effectively illustrate the impact of regional tectonics.</p>
<p>V. Exploring the Wilds: Geology of Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness Park</p>
<p>Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness, a rugged expanse in the northwestern Diablo Range, offers hikers an immersive experience into the core geology of the California Coast Ranges. Its diverse topography, from deep canyons to rolling hills and rocky peaks, is a direct reflection of a complex geological history dominated by ancient tectonic plate collisions and the ongoing influence of major fault systems.</p>
<p>A. Geological Context: Position within the Diablo Range and Influence of Major Fault Systems</p>
<p>Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness is centrally located within the Diablo Range, a major structural uplift in the Coast Ranges. The fundamental geological framework of this area is characterized by the juxtaposition of the three major Mesozoic rock assemblages: the Franciscan Complex, the Coast Range Ophiolite, and the Great Valley Sequence. These units are typically separated by major fault zones, most notably the Coast Range Fault, which in this region is itself tightly folded on a kilometer scale. This folded fault brings the Franciscan Complex tectonically beneath the Coast Range Ophiolite and the overlying Great Valley Group.</p>
<p>These older, highly deformed Mesozoic rocks are unconformably overlain by younger marine sedimentary rocks of Miocene age. This entire package—Mesozoic basement and Miocene cover—has been subsequently folded and cut by faults belonging to the San Andreas Fault system. The most significant of these younger faults in the Sunol area is the Calaveras Fault, a major active strand of the San Andreas system. The landscape of Sunol, including features like Mission Peak (accessible via trails originating in Sunol), is a product of ongoing compression and uplift related to the interplay between the Hayward Fault (to the west) and the Calaveras Fault (which traverses parts of the wilderness).</p>
<p>B. Exposed Rock Units</p>
<p>The trails of Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness traverse a variety of rock types, each with its own story. 1. Franciscan Complex (Mesozoic): This is a dominant unit in the Sunol area, forming many of the rugged terrains.</p>
<p>Outcrops include hard, resistant sandstone, as well as distinctive metamorphic boulders of greenstone (altered basalt), blueschist (high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphic rock indicative of subduction), and metachert (metamorphosed chert). These metamorphic rocks are hallmarks of the Franciscan.</p>
<p>&quot;Cave Rocks,&quot; a notable landmark in the park, is described as a massive metamorphic outcrop, likely composed of resistant blocks within the Franciscan Complex.</p>
<p>Recent geological mapping in the Sunol Wilderness has revealed evidence for interbedding of siliciclastic (sedimentary) and detrital serpentinite horizons within the Franciscan Complex. This suggests that serpentinite, likely eroded from exposed ophiolitic sources, was being incorporated into the Franciscan accretionary wedge as sediments.</p>
<p>2. Coast Range Ophiolite (Jurassic): Remnants of ancient oceanic crust are also present, primarily as:</p>
<p>Serpentinite: Exposures of this greenish, often waxy or slickensided rock are found in the park. Serpentinite is derived from the alteration of ultramafic mantle rocks of the ophiolite. Due to its unique chemistry (high magnesium, low calcium), serpentinite soils often support specialized native plant communities, making these areas botanically distinct.</p>
<p>3. Great Valley Sequence (Cretaceous): Sedimentary rocks of the Great Valley Sequence are tectonically juxtaposed with the Franciscan Complex and Coast Range Ophiolite, typically lying structurally above them along the folded Coast Range Fault.</p>
<p>An interesting feature noted in recent mapping is the presence of basal olistostrome horizons within the Great Valley Group in this area. Olistostromes are sedimentary deposits composed of chaotic masses of rock (olistoliths) that have slid or slumped into a basin. In Sunol, these olistostromes include mixed detrital serpentinite and siliciclastic rocks, indicating that as Great Valley sediments were being deposited, there were nearby sources of eroding serpentinite (from the ophiolite) and other sedimentary rocks, likely due to active faulting and uplift.</p>
<p>4. Miocene Marine Sedimentary Rocks: These younger rocks unconformably overlie the older Mesozoic complexes and consist primarily of sandstone.</p>
<p>Sandstone outcrops within these Miocene units are known to contain fossil bivalves (clams), indicating deposition in a marine environment when the sea covered this region during the Miocene epoch. These fossiliferous sandstones have been uplifted and tilted by subsequent tectonic activity.</p>
<p>C. The Calaveras Fault Zone: Dominant Structural Control</p>
<p>The Calaveras Fault is a major, active, right-lateral strike-slip fault that is part of the broader San Andreas Fault system. It exerts a dominant structural and geomorphic influence on the Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness, passing through or very near the park.</p>
<p>The Calaveras Fault accommodates a significant amount of the Pacific-North American plate motion. It is characterized by segments that exhibit aseismic creep (slow, continuous movement) and segments that are locked and accumulate strain, periodically rupturing in moderate to large earthquakes (e.g., the 1984 M6.2 Morgan Hill earthquake occurred on a southern segment of the Calaveras Fault).</p>
<p>Within the Sunol area, recent geological mapping suggests that numerous younger faults may define a broader zone of displacement associated with the Calaveras Fault. These faults may have formed as a result of migrating step-overs along the main Calaveras trace. Such step-overs in strike-slip fault systems can lead to localized areas of compression (forming uplifts or pressure ridges) or extension (forming sag ponds or small basins).</p>
<p>The active nature of the Calaveras Fault and its associated structures is evident in the landscape. Some of these faults appear to deflect stream drainages and cause the ponding of alluvium (stream sediments) upstream of fault traces. These geomorphic expressions are direct evidence of ongoing tectonic deformation.</p>
<p>The complex geology of features like Yerba Buena Ridge, which may be visible from or partly within the Sunol Wilderness, preserves evidence of the long-term development of the Calaveras-Hayward fault system and the uplift of the Diablo Range.</p>
<p>The Calaveras Fault is not merely a line on a map; it is a dynamic zone of deformation that has actively sculpted the topography of Sunol. It is responsible for the juxtaposition of different rock units, the uplift of ridges, the creation of linear valleys, and the &quot;wild and rugged scenes&quot; that characterize the wilderness. Hikers in Sunol are, in effect, traversing a landscape shaped by one of the Bay Area&#x27;s most significant earthquake faults.</p>
<p>D. Hiking Through Geologic Time: Interpreting Outcrops</p>
<p>The varied geology of Sunol Ohlone Wilderness provides numerous opportunities for hikers to observe and interpret geological features:</p>
<p>&quot;Little Yosemite&quot;: This popular area along Alameda Creek features a gorge with large, jumbled rock outcrops. The &quot;wild and rugged&quot; nature of the rocks suggests they are likely part of the Franciscan Complex, possibly a mélange with resistant blocks of sandstone or greenstone, or fault-shattered bedrock. The gorge itself may have formed where Alameda Creek cut down through a particularly resistant band of rock or along a zone of structural weakness related to faulting.</p>
<p>Metamorphic Boulders and Outcrops (Greenstone, Blueschist, Metachert): The presence of these rocks, often as prominent boulders or rugged outcrops like &quot;Cave Rocks,&quot; signifies areas underlain by the Franciscan Complex. These are remnants of an ancient subduction zone, where oceanic rocks were carried to great depths and subjected to high pressures and moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Serpentinite Zones: Easily identified by their characteristic greenish, often waxy or polished appearance, serpentinite outcrops frequently support a distinct, often sparse, native flora adapted to the magnesium-rich and calcium-poor soils derived from these rocks.</p>
<p>Sandstone with Fossil Bivalves: Outcrops of Miocene marine sandstone, containing fossil clams or other bivalves, tell of a time when this part of the Diablo Range was submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean, much more recently than the formation of the Franciscan or Great Valley rocks. The tilting of these fossiliferous beds indicates post-Miocene uplift and deformation.</p>
<p>Strath Terraces: The presence of multiple levels of strath terraces (former valley floors now abandoned as the stream cuts deeper) along creeks like Alameda Creek is evidence of progressive stream incision. This incision is often driven by ongoing tectonic uplift of the region, related to activity on faults like the Calaveras. Drainage rearrangements, including stream capture, may also be linked to this tectonic activity.</p>
<p>E. Fossil Potential</p>
<p>The potential for fossil discoveries in Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness varies depending on the rock units encountered:</p>
<p>Miocene Marine Sandstones: These are the most promising units for finding macrofossils within the park, as they are known to contain fossil bivalves (clams). Other marine invertebrates might also be present.</p>
<p>Franciscan Complex: Generally, the Franciscan Complex is poor in well-preserved macrofossils due to the intense deformation and metamorphism its rocks have undergone. However, the chert units within the Franciscan are composed of the microscopic skeletons of radiolaria. While these require microscopic examination, they are a fundamental component of these rocks.</p>
<p>Great Valley Sequence: Elsewhere in California, the Great Valley Sequence can be quite fossiliferous, yielding ammonites, bivalves, and other marine fossils. If relatively undeformed sections of Great Valley rocks are exposed in Sunol, they could potentially contain such fossils.</p>
<p>Pleistocene and Younger Deposits: While the Sunol Valley region more broadly (including areas outside the wilderness park) has yielded Pleistocene vertebrate fossils such as mastodon, bison, camels, fish, and horses from deposits like the Livermore Gravels or Santa Clara Formation , the presence and extent of such young, fossiliferous deposits within the rugged terrain of the wilderness park itself are less certain. If present, alluvial terraces or cave deposits could hold such remains.</p>
<p>Table V.1: Key Geologic Formations of Sunol Ohlone Wilderness Park</p>
<p>Visual Aid Note: A geological map covering the Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness, such as the USGS MF-2342 &quot;Geologic Map and Map Database of the Oakland Metropolitan Area&quot; by R.W. Graymer (2000) if it provides sufficient detail for this area, or potentially newer mapping alluded to by Graymer&#x27;s 2023 GSA abstract , would be essential. An illustrative diagram showing the folded Coast Range Fault and the relationship between the Franciscan, Coast Range Ophiolite, Great Valley Group, and the overlying Miocene strata, all cut by the Calaveras Fault, would greatly aid understanding. Photographs of &quot;Little Yosemite,&quot; &quot;Cave Rocks,&quot; serpentinite outcrops, and any visible fossiliferous sandstone layers would be beneficial.</p>
<p>VI. The Hayward Fault: Architect of the East Bay Landscape</p>
<p>The Hayward Fault is one of the most significant geological structures in the San Francisco Bay Area, a potent reminder of the dynamic tectonic forces shaping the region. Its influence extends across the East Bay, impacting the geology, topography, and seismic hazard of the areas frequented by hikers.</p>
<p>A. Tectonic Significance and Regional Impact</p>
<p>The Hayward Fault is a major, active, right-lateral strike-slip fault, forming a critical component of the San Andreas Fault System. It runs along the western base of the East Bay Hills, extending for approximately 74 miles (119 km) from San Pablo Bay in the north to south of Fremont. The fault accommodates a significant portion of the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, with an estimated slip rate of about 9 mm/year in its northern segment and potentially connecting with the Calaveras Fault to the south.</p>
<p>The Hayward Fault is notorious for its seismic activity. It generated a major earthquake in 1868, with an estimated magnitude of 6.8 to 7.0, causing widespread damage in the then sparsely populated Bay Area. Paleoseismic studies indicate that the fault has produced similarly large earthquakes roughly every 150-200 years on average, suggesting that it is currently late in its typical earthquake cycle. In addition to large, infrequent earthquakes, portions of the Hayward Fault exhibit aseismic creep, a slow, continuous movement along the fault trace that does not generate earthquakes but does cause visible deformation of structures built across it.</p>
<p>Tectonically, the Hayward Fault plays a crucial role in the uplift and deformation of the East Bay Hills. The predominantly strike-slip motion along the fault is accompanied by a component of compression, particularly where the fault bends or interacts with other structures. This transpression is a key driver for the ongoing uplift of the hills to its east. The fault acts as a major geological boundary, juxtaposing different rock types and structural blocks. For instance, it separates the Franciscan Complex and Great Valley Sequence rocks of the East Bay Hills from the younger alluvial deposits of the San Francisco Bay plain.</p>
<p>B. Geomorphic Expressions Relevant to Hikers</p>
<p>Active faults like the Hayward create a distinctive suite of landforms, or geomorphic expressions, that can often be observed by astute hikers. Recognizing these features provides tangible evidence of the fault&#x27;s presence and its ongoing impact on the landscape:</p>
<p>Linear Valleys and Troughs: Fault zones often consist of crushed and weakened rock that is more easily eroded than the surrounding bedrock. This preferential erosion can lead to the formation of remarkably straight, linear valleys or troughs that follow the fault trace. The valley occupied by Highway 13 in Oakland is a classic example along the Hayward Fault.</p>
<p>Offset Drainages (Streams): As a stream flows across an active strike-slip fault, the repeated fault movements progressively displace the downstream portion of the channel relative to the upstream portion. This results in distinctive right-angle bends or &quot;Z-shaped&quot; offsets in the stream course. Strawberry Creek and Blackberry Creek on the UC Berkeley campus exhibit clear right-lateral offsets where they cross strands of the Hayward Fault.</p>
<p>Shutter Ridges: When a ridge is displaced laterally by a strike-slip fault, it can move in front of a valley or canyon on the opposite side of the fault, effectively blocking or &quot;shuttering&quot; its mouth. This creates a distinctive landscape where drainages appear to be dammed by a displaced ridge.</p>
<p>Fault Scarps: While most common with faults that have vertical movement (dip-slip faults), scarps (steep slopes or steps in the land surface) can also form along strike-slip faults, particularly in areas of transpression where there is a component of uplift, or where different rock types with varying resistance to erosion are juxtaposed by faulting.</p>
<p>Sags, Sag Ponds, and Springs: Localized depressions or sags can form along fault traces due to tensional stresses at releasing bends or step-overs, or due to uneven ground movement. These sags may collect water, forming sag ponds. Faults can also act as conduits or barriers to groundwater flow, leading to the alignment of springs or seeps along the fault trace.</p>
<p>Anomalous Drainage Patterns: Beyond simple offsets, faults can cause more complex disruptions to drainage networks, including beheaded streams (where the upstream portion of a stream is captured by another drainage due to fault movement) and defeated streams (streams that are unable to cut across an uplifting fault block). Two former, now dry, channels of Strawberry Creek on the UC Berkeley campus are interpreted as beheaded channels related to Hayward Fault activity.</p>
<p>Faceted Spurs: Triangular-shaped faces on the ends of ridges (spurs) can be formed by faulting, particularly where a range-front fault truncates the spurs.</p>
<p>The ability to recognize these geomorphic features allows a hiker to act as a geological detective, &quot;reading&quot; the landscape for signs of active faulting. Even where bedrock exposures are poor or the fault trace itself is obscured by vegetation or development, these landforms provide compelling evidence of the underlying tectonic processes that continue to shape the East Bay.</p>
<p>C. Structural Relationship to the Geology of the Study Areas</p>
<p>The Hayward Fault, while not directly traversing all the hiking areas discussed, exerts a significant influence on their regional geological and tectonic setting:</p>
<p>Mount Diablo: The Hayward Fault lies to the west of Mount Diablo. The uplift of Mount Diablo is primarily driven by thrust faulting beneath it, but this compressional regime is part of the broader deformation field associated with the San Andreas Fault system, of which the Hayward Fault is a major component. The East Bay Hills, which lie between the Hayward Fault and Mount Diablo, preserve a thick sequence of Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata that are also found on the flanks of Mount Diablo, indicating a shared regional history of deposition and subsequent deformation.</p>
<p>Lake Del Valle/Livermore Area: The Hayward Fault, along with the Calaveras Fault, forms the western tectonic boundary for the broader region that includes the Livermore Valley. The Livermore Valley itself is a structural basin situated between this western fault system and the Greenville-Tesla fault system to the east. The stresses and displacements accommodated by the Hayward Fault contribute to the overall tectonic environment that led to the formation and ongoing evolution of the Livermore Basin.</p>
<p>Sunol Ohlone Wilderness: The Calaveras Fault, which runs through or near the Sunol Wilderness, is a major splay of the San Andreas system and is closely linked to the Hayward Fault, particularly in the South Bay where they may merge at depth. The tectonic activity and landscape development in Sunol are therefore intimately connected to the behavior of both the Calaveras and Hayward faults.</p>
<p>D. Visual Aid Focus</p>
<p>To best illustrate the significance of the Hayward Fault for a scientifically-minded hiker, several types of visual aids are crucial:</p>
<p>Regional Fault Map: A map clearly showing the trace of the Hayward Fault in relation to other major faults in the Bay Area (San Andreas, Calaveras, Greenville, Concord) and the locations of the four hiking areas (Mount Diablo, Lake Del Valle/Livermore, Sunol). This provides the broad tectonic context.</p>
<p>Geologic Cross-Section of the East Bay: A particularly valuable illustration would be a cross-section depicting the subsurface geometry of the Hayward Fault. The &quot;flower structure&quot; model, as proposed by Graymer (2000) and referenced in Karasaki et al. , is an important concept. This model shows the main, near-vertical Hayward Fault at depth, with subsidiary faults splaying upwards towards the surface, resembling the petals of a flower in cross-section. This structure is typical of major strike-slip faults in transpressional settings and helps explain the distribution of deformation and uplift in the East Bay Hills. A simplified diagram of this flower structure, showing the Hayward Fault and its relationship to the Wildcat and Moraga faults, would be highly instructive.</p>
<p>Photographs or Diagrams of Geomorphic Features: Clear examples of landforms created by the Hayward Fault, such as offset streams (e.g., Strawberry Creek at UC Berkeley ), linear valleys, shutter ridges, or fault scarps, would help hikers visualize these features and learn to identify them in the field. If specific examples from the park areas are not available, well-documented regional examples can be used.</p>
<p>Understanding the Hayward Fault is key to appreciating the dynamic and hazard-prone geological environment of the East Bay. Its past movements have sculpted the landscape, and its future movements will continue to reshape it.</p>
<p>VII. Synthesis for the Scientifically-Minded Hiker</p>
<p>The geological landscapes of Mount Diablo, Lake Del Valle, Sunol Ohlone Wilderness, and the Livermore area, while each possessing unique characteristics, are bound together by a shared and dynamic geological history. This report has aimed to provide the scientifically-minded hiker with the foundational knowledge to interpret these landscapes, transforming a walk through nature into an exploration of deep time and powerful Earth processes.</p>
<p>A. Interconnected Geological Narratives of the Parks</p>
<p>A recurring theme throughout these areas is the presence of a Mesozoic &quot;basement&quot; composed of the Franciscan Complex, the Great Valley Sequence, and the Coast Range Ophiolite. These ancient rocks, formed during a long period of oceanic plate subduction, tell tales of deep oceans, volcanic activity, and the collision of tectonic plates. The chaotic mélange of the Franciscan, with its exotic blueschists, speaks to the intense pressures and temperatures of the subduction zone. The more orderly sandstones and shales of the Great Valley Sequence record sediment shed from the ancestral Sierra Nevada into a vast forearc basin. The serpentinites and pillow basalts of the Coast Range Ophiolite are tangible remnants of former oceanic crust.</p>
<p>This older geological tapestry was subsequently cut, displaced, and deformed by the Cenozoic development of the San Andreas Fault system. Major faults like the Hayward and Calaveras, and their associated structures like the Greenville and Mount Diablo Thrust faults, have uplifted mountain ranges, created basins, and juxtaposed disparate rock types. Younger Cenozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, deposited in these evolving basins and on their flanks, record this more recent history of landscape development. Mount Diablo&#x27;s dramatic uplift, the formation of the Livermore alluvial basin, and the rugged, fault-controlled terrain of Sunol are all expressions of this ongoing tectonic activity. Each park, therefore, offers a different window into this grand, interconnected geological narrative.</p>
<p>B. Key Geological Processes and Features to Observe and Interpret on Hikes</p>
<p>Armed with the information in this report, hikers can become active interpreters of the geological environment:</p>
<p>Rock Identification: Pay attention to the color, texture, layering (or lack thereof), and any visible minerals in rock outcrops. Is it a reddish, hard, layered rock (likely Franciscan chert)? A greenish, waxy, possibly slickensided rock (serpentinite)? A tan-colored, gritty rock with visible sand grains (sandstone, like Domengine or Briones)? A dark, fine-grained rock with pillow shapes (basalt)? A chaotic mixture of different rock types (Franciscan mélange)?</p>
<p>Structural Clues: Look for evidence of deformation. Are sedimentary layers flat-lying, tilted, or even vertical or overturned (as seen extensively on Mount Diablo)? Do you see polished or grooved surfaces on rocks (slickensides), indicating fault movement? Are there zones of intensely crushed or broken rock? Do rock types change abruptly across a valley or gully, suggesting a fault? Are there large-scale up-arches (anticlines) or down-warps (synclines) visible in the landscape?</p>
<p>Geomorphic Interpretation: Relate the shape of the land to the underlying geology and tectonic processes. Are ridges formed by resistant rock layers (hogbacks)? Are valleys aligned with known fault traces? Do streams show unusual right-angle bends (offsets)? Does the landscape show evidence of recent uplift (incised streams, terraces)?</p>
<p>Fossil Hunting (Visually): In formations known to be fossiliferous (e.g., Briones Formation, Domengine Sandstone, parts of the Livermore Formation), carefully examine weathered surfaces of sandstones and shales for imprints or fragments of shells, bones, or plant material. Remember, even microscopic fossils (like radiolaria in chert) are significant.</p>
<p>C. Guidance on Ethical Fossil Observation and Collection</p>
<p>The discovery of fossils can be an exciting experience. However, it is crucial to be an ethical observer.</p>
<p>Observe and Photograph, Do Not Collect: In almost all public parklands, including Mount Diablo State Park, Lake Del Valle Regional Park, and Sunol Ohlone Regional Wilderness, the collection of fossils, rocks, or any other natural material is prohibited without specific scientific permits. These resources are protected for the enjoyment and education of all visitors and for scientific research. Leave fossils in place for others to see and for potential study by paleontologists.</p>
<p>Report Significant Finds: If you believe you have found a significant or unusual fossil (e.g., vertebrate bones), note its precise location, take photographs, and report it to park authorities or a local museum/university geology department. This can contribute to scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Private Lands: Collection on private land requires the explicit permission of the landowner. The primary goal for the hiker should be in-situ observation, photography, and the intellectual satisfaction of understanding the fossil&#x27;s context within the geological story.</p>
<p>D. Recommendations for Further Geological Exploration and Learning</p>
<p>The journey into understanding East Bay geology need not end with this report. Numerous resources are available for continued learning:</p>
<p>Local Museums: Visit institutions with geological and paleontological exhibits. The Mount Diablo Summit Museum offers displays relevant to the mountain&#x27;s geology and fossils. The University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) in Berkeley has excellent exhibits (though collections are primarily for research) and a wealth of online resources.</p>
<p>Field Guides and Books: Several excellent books delve into Bay Area geology. &quot;Geology of the San Francisco Bay Region&quot; by Doris Sloan is a highly recommended resource for understanding the regional geology in an accessible manner.</p>
<p>Online Resources:</p>
<p>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS): The USGS website (usgs.gov) is a primary source for geological maps, reports, and earthquake information. Many of the cited documents in this report are from the USGS. Look for publications related to specific quadrangles or geological features.</p>
<p>California Geological Survey (CGS): The CGS (conservation.ca.gov/cgs) provides similar resources focused on California geology, including regional geologic maps and hazard assessments.</p>
<p>Mount Diablo Interpretive Association (MDIA): The MDIA website (mdia.org) offers specific geological information about Mount Diablo, including maps and guides.</p>
<p>Geological Societies: Local geological societies often host lectures and field trips that can provide deeper insights and hands-on learning opportunities.</p>
<p>By understanding the regional context and key geological principles outlined in this report, a scientifically-minded hiker can actively engage with the landscape. Every rock outcrop, every landform, every tilted bed becomes a clue. The hiker transforms into a geological detective, piecing together the evidence to reconstruct the immense history recorded in the Earth beneath their feet. This report serves as a toolkit for that detective work, aiming to enrich the hiking experience by revealing the profound geological narratives that make the East Bay&#x27;s natural areas so compelling.</p>
<p>Table VII.1: Summary of Observable Geological Features and Interpretations for Hikers</p>
