        <p>Strategic Modernization Plan: Ensuring Reliability and Resilience for the Next Decade</p>
<p>1.0 Executive Summary</p>
<p>This report presents a comprehensive 10-year strategic modernization plan for the utility&#x27;s 160 MGD conventional surface water treatment plant. It is designed to guide senior management in navigating the complex operational, regulatory, and financial landscape of the coming decade. The analysis recognizes that the plant is at a critical inflection point, where the compounding risks of 50-year-old infrastructure are converging with an unprecedented wave of stringent new federal and state regulations. Proactive, holistic investment is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity for ensuring long-term reliability, compliance, and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The core of this report is built on two intersecting drivers: End-of-Life Infrastructure and Forced Modernization. Decades-old assets, from concrete basins to filter underdrains and control systems, are nearing or have exceeded their design life, elevating the risk of catastrophic failure, service disruptions, and escalating emergency repair costs. Simultaneously, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized new rules, most notably the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), which mandates significant capital investment in advanced treatment by 2029.</p>
<p>This non-discretionary regulatory mandate creates a strategic opportunity. By bundling necessary PFAS treatment projects with long-deferred infrastructure renewal and efficiency upgrades, the utility can maximize the value of its capital program and create a more compelling, comprehensive application for federal funding. This report outlines a pathway to leverage this opportunity through a phased, data-driven modernization program.</p>
<p>Key Recommendations:</p>
<p>Adopt a Holistic, Risk-Based Asset Management Framework: Transition from reactive, time-based maintenance to a proactive, condition-based strategy aligned with ISO 55001 principles. This involves conducting a comprehensive condition assessment of all critical assets and prioritizing repairs and replacements using a Likelihood of Failure (LoF) versus Consequence of Failure (CoF) risk matrix.</p>
<p>Implement a Multi-Barrier Treatment Modernization Program: Upgrade core treatment processes to enhance performance and reduce operational costs. Key initiatives include converting existing filters to Biologically Active Filtration (BAF) following the ozone commissioning, installing On-Site Sodium Hypochlorite Generation (OSHG) to improve safety and chemical stability, and deploying advanced, real-time coagulation control and corrosion monitoring systems.</p>
<p>Embrace the Digital Plant: Invest in a foundational &quot;third-generation&quot; SCADA system and build a plant-wide Digital Twin. This dynamic virtual model will integrate real-time data from SCADA, labs, and new Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors to enable predictive forecasting, process optimization, and AI-driven predictive maintenance. This digital layer is essential for managing the complex interplay between new regulations (PFAS, DBPs, Lead and Copper) and optimizing the new ozone-chloramination treatment scheme.</p>
<p>Pursue a Bundled Federal Funding Strategy: Structure the modernization initiatives as a single, cohesive program to apply for a Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan. A comprehensive program that addresses emerging contaminants, aging infrastructure, and climate resilience is an ideal candidate for WIFIA&#x27;s low-interest, long-term financing. State Revolving Funds (SRF) should be leveraged to meet the required 51% match.</p>
<p>Invest in the Workforce of the Future: Run a parallel human capital strategy to recruit, train, and retain the next generation of operators. This includes establishing a formal apprenticeship program, leveraging AWWA e-learning for advanced skills, and using modern knowledge-capture tools like augmented reality (AR) to preserve the institutional knowledge of retiring staff.</p>
<p>Financial Outlook:</p>
<p>The proposed 10-year modernization program represents a significant but essential capital investment. However, the financial analysis projects a strong return through substantial operational savings, risk mitigation, and enhanced asset longevity. Key initiatives like OSHG and digital twin-enabled process optimization offer payback periods of as little as 1-3 years. The overall program is projected to reduce chemical and energy costs by 15-25%, decrease unplanned downtime by over 50%, and avoid millions in costs associated with emergency repairs and regulatory non-compliance. By securing WIFIA and SRF financing, the utility can implement this critical program while maintaining rate stability for its customers.</p>
<p>This report provides the data-driven justification and strategic roadmap to transform the plant into a more resilient, efficient, and compliant facility, prepared to meet the water quality challenges of the next generation.</p>
<p>2.0 The Strategic Imperative: Navigating an Evolving Landscape</p>
<p>The utility&#x27;s water treatment plant stands at a critical inflection point. For five decades, it has reliably served the community, but the operational paradigm under which it was designed and built is no longer viable for the future. The risks associated with a reactive, &quot;run-to-failure&quot; management approach are escalating to an untenable level, driven by the convergence of two powerful and unyielding forces: the accelerating decay of end-of-life infrastructure and the arrival of the most significant wave of regulatory pressure the water industry has seen in a generation.</p>
<p>The first force is End-of-Life Infrastructure. The majority of the nation&#x27;s water and wastewater treatment plants were constructed in the 1970s, spurred by the passage of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. These facilities were typically designed with a 40- to 50-year service life. As a result, core components of the plant—from concrete sedimentation basins and filter underdrains to large-diameter pipes, pumps, and control systems—are now operating at or beyond their expected useful life. This aging profile translates directly into a higher probability of failure, leading to increased maintenance requirements, greater risk of service disruptions, and the high cost of unplanned emergency repairs. Deferring necessary upgrades is no longer a sustainable financial strategy; it is an accumulation of risk that threatens both operational reliability and public health. A case study of the 50-year-old Winona WTP in Peabody, Massachusetts, illustrates this reality vividly, where original filter media and control systems led to frequent compliance issues and concerns about water quality before a major rehabilitation was undertaken.</p>
<p>The second, and more acute, force is Unprecedented Regulatory Pressure. The regulatory landscape is undergoing a fundamental shift. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized its National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), establishing near-zero Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for several compounds. Conventional treatment, as currently configured at the plant, provides virtually no removal of these &quot;forever chemicals.&quot; Compliance, mandated by 2029, will require the installation of advanced treatment technologies like Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) or Ion Exchange (IX), representing a massive, non-discretionary capital investment. This is compounded by the final Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI), which mandate the full replacement of lead service lines and lower the lead action level, placing greater scrutiny on the plant&#x27;s corrosion control treatment (CCT) strategy, especially given the upcoming switch to ozone and chloramination.</p>
<p>This confluence of factors gives rise to the concept of Forced Modernization. The regulatory necessity to invest heavily in PFAS treatment creates a unique strategic opportunity. Rather than viewing this as an isolated compliance project, it should be the catalyst for a holistic modernization program. Attempting to bolt on a multi-million-dollar GAC system to an already aging and fragile plant is a poor engineering and financial strategy. It fails to address the underlying risks and results in a facility with mismatched asset lifecycles.</p>
<p>Instead, the utility should leverage this moment to bundle the mandatory PFAS project with a comprehensive suite of upgrades that address deferred maintenance, improve operational efficiency, and build resilience for the next 30 years. A single, integrated capital program that tackles PFAS, SCADA obsolescence, filter rehabilitation, and chemical system safety is a far more robust and defensible plan. This approach not only maximizes the engineering value of each dollar spent but also creates a much stronger and more compelling application for large-scale federal funding programs like the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA), which favor comprehensive projects that address multiple strategic priorities like emerging contaminants, aging infrastructure, and climate resilience. This report outlines the technical and financial justification for such a strategic, bundled approach.</p>
<p>3.0 Current-State Diagnostic and Vulnerability Assessment</p>
<p>A 50-year-old conventional surface water treatment plant, despite a history of reliable service, inherently carries significant vulnerabilities due to the natural lifecycle of its core assets. A diagnostic assessment, guided by industry best practices from the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the Water Research Foundation (WRF), reveals probable high-risk areas that require immediate attention and form the basis for a risk-based modernization plan. These vulnerabilities are not isolated; they are often interdependent, creating compounding risks that can lead to cascading failures.</p>
<p>3.1 Structural and Mechanical Vulnerabilities</p>
<p>The physical plant infrastructure, particularly the large concrete and mechanical systems, represents the most significant capital assets and, after five decades, the most tangible source of risk.</p>
<p>Concrete Basins (Flocculation/Sedimentation): The plant&#x27;s flocculation and sedimentation basins are composed of reinforced concrete that has been in continuous service for half a century. The primary degradation modes for such structures include surface spalling, structural cracking, and corrosion of the embedded reinforcing steel (rebar). Visual inspection is the first step, looking for tell-tale signs like rust-colored stains on the concrete surface, which indicate underlying rebar corrosion, or yellowish concrete, which can suggest chemical attack. However, visual inspection alone is insufficient. A comprehensive condition assessment should include quantitative methods. A delamination survey, or &quot;hammer sounding,&quot; can detect hollow sounds that signify a separation of the concrete from the rebar, a clear indicator of corrosion. For a more advanced diagnosis, a half-cell potential test can be performed to create a &quot;temperature map&quot; of corrosion activity across the basin surfaces, identifying hotspots before they become visible spalls. The case study of the Winona WTP highlighted the complexity of retrofitting these aging basins, which required extensive demolition, cutting, and installation of new concrete walls within the existing tanks, underscoring the high cost of remediation if degradation is left unaddressed.</p>
<p>Dual-Media Filters: The filtration system is the heart of the plant, and its failure has immediate consequences for water quality. Two components are of paramount concern:</p>
<p>Filter Media: After 50 years of service, the original anthracite and sand media is almost certainly compromised. The constant hydraulic stress of filtration and backwashing causes media grains to fracture and break down, a process known as attrition. It is not unusual to lose up to one inch of media depth per year. This changes the media&#x27;s effective size and uniformity coefficient, leading to reduced contaminant removal, a faster rate of head loss, and an increased risk of turbidity or pathogen breakthrough. The only way to definitively assess media condition is through core sampling and laboratory analysis.</p>
<p>Filter Underdrains: This is arguably one of the highest-risk assets in the plant. Many plants from this era were constructed with monolithic, grouted-in-place clay tile block underdrains. These systems are highly susceptible to failure from hydraulic stresses or corrosion of ancillary components. Failure can be catastrophic, and because the underdrain is a monolithic structure, repair often means complete demolition of the filter floor with jackhammers and a full rebuild—a costly and time-intensive process. Symptoms of underdrain failure include visible media &quot;boils&quot; or vortexing during backwash, uneven bed expansion, and the presence of filter media in the clearwell or backwash water. While direct inspection requires the complete removal of all filter media, the risk associated with these older designs is so high that proactive replacement with modern, low-profile systems (e.g., bolted stainless steel or PVC laterals) is often the most prudent long-term strategy.</p>
<p>Large-Diameter Valves and Piping: The consequence of failure for critical large-diameter valves—such as filter-to-waste, backwash, or main isolation valves—is extremely high. AWWA Manual M77, Condition Assessment of Water Mains, provides a robust framework that can be adapted for large-bore piping within the plant. Assessment should start with a desktop analysis of failure history and operational data, but this should be supplemented with direct assessment technologies like acoustic monitoring to detect leaks and electromagnetic testing to identify stress anomalies or corrosion hotspots. For steel water storage tanks, AWWA Manual M42 recommends interior inspections and washouts at least every three years to identify corrosion before it penetrates the steel, a practice that can be adapted for large steel process tanks or pipes.</p>
<p>3.2 Control System Obsolescence</p>
<p>While less visible than a failing concrete wall, the plant&#x27;s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is a critical and likely obsolete vulnerability. The lifecycle of control system components is far shorter than that of physical infrastructure. SCADA servers and workstations typically have a useful life of about 5 years before their operating systems are no longer supported and replacement parts become scarce. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the industrial hardware that directly controls pumps and valves, have a longer but still finite lifespan of around 15 years, after which manufacturers discontinue the product line and support.</p>
<p>A 50-year-old plant is likely operating a &quot;second generation&quot; SCADA system, characterized by early PLC models (like the now-obsolete Allen-Bradley SLC or GE 90-30 series) and basic HMI software. These legacy systems suffer from significant limitations:</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Risks: They often run on unsupported operating systems (e.g., Windows XP or 7) that no longer receive security patches, making them highly vulnerable to cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Limited Integration: They lack the modern communication protocols needed to integrate with new IIoT sensors, cloud-based analytics platforms, or enterprise business systems.</p>
<p>Poor Data Management: They typically have rudimentary data historians and trending capabilities, preventing operators from performing advanced analytics or identifying subtle, long-term performance degradation.</p>
<p>The plant must plan for a transition to a &quot;third generation&quot; SCADA system. This is not merely a hardware replacement but a philosophical shift. A modern SCADA platform is built on a virtualized server environment, utilizes a plant-wide enterprise historian, and provides secure mobile and remote access. This architecture is the essential foundation for implementing the advanced digital tools discussed later in this report, such as a Digital Twin.</p>
<p>The degradation of these interdependent systems creates a negative feedback loop that accelerates overall plant decline. For instance, aging filter media and underdrains lead to poor hydraulic performance and shorter filter runs. An operator, working with a legacy SCADA system that lacks real-time analytical tools, may only see the high headloss alarm and respond by increasing the frequency of backwashes. This action, while seemingly logical, increases the consumption of treated water, energy for backwash pumps, and places additional stress cycles on aging backwash valves and actuators, accelerating their failure. The obsolete control system prevents management from seeing the holistic picture: that a capital investment in filter rehabilitation would yield significant O&amp;M savings in water, energy, and mechanical repairs. This compounding risk underscores the need for a comprehensive modernization program that addresses the physical, mechanical, and digital systems as an integrated whole.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the key vulnerabilities and aligns them with industry-standard assessment protocols, providing a clear checklist for a comprehensive condition assessment program.</p>
<p>Table 3.1: Summary of Key Asset Vulnerabilities and Recommended Assessment Techniques</p>
<p>4.0 Regulatory Horizon Scan: Preparing for 2035</p>
<p>The next decade will be defined by a paradigm shift in drinking water regulations. A suite of new and revised federal and state rules will impose stricter limits, require more advanced treatment, and demand a more sophisticated approach to managing water quality from the source to the tap. For a plant with an impending ozone upgrade and an existing chloramination system, navigating this new landscape requires a proactive and integrated strategy. The following analysis details the most critical regulations and their operational implications.</p>
<p>4.1 Final PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR)</p>
<p>The most significant regulatory driver for the water industry in a generation is the EPA&#x27;s final rule for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), announced in April 2024. This rule is not an incremental change; it is a fundamental mandate for advanced treatment at thousands of utilities nationwide.</p>
<p>The Mandate: The rule establishes legally enforceable Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for five individual PFAS and regulates a mixture of four others via a Hazard Index (HI). The MCLs are set at extremely low concentrations, measured in parts per trillion (ppt) :</p>
<p>PFOA: 4.0 ppt</p>
<p>PFOS: 4.0 ppt</p>
<p>PFNA: 10 ppt</p>
<p>PFHxS: 10 ppt</p>
<p>HFPO-DA (GenX): 10 ppt</p>
<p>Hazard Index for mixtures of PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS, and GenX: 1.0 (unitless)</p>
<p>Compliance Timeline: Public water systems must complete initial monitoring within three years (by 2027) and must comply with the MCLs within five years (by 2029). This is an aggressive timeline for planning, designing, financing, and constructing major capital projects.</p>
<p>Treatment Implications: The plant&#x27;s current conventional treatment train (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration) is ineffective for removing these soluble, persistent chemicals. Compliance will necessitate the addition of an advanced treatment barrier. The most common and proven technologies are Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) adsorption and Ion Exchange (IX). While Reverse Osmosis (RO) is also effective, it is more energy-intensive and creates a concentrate waste stream, making GAC or IX the more likely choice for this specific application. The decision to install and operate these systems represents a significant, long-term capital and operational expense.</p>
<p>State-Level Pressure: It is critical to recognize that federal rules often represent a floor, not a ceiling. States with active environmental programs, such as California, often adopt their own, sometimes more stringent, regulations or notification levels. The utility must plan for a future where state-level requirements may become even stricter than the federal MCLs.</p>
<p>4.2 Revised Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) Improvements (LCRI)</p>
<p>While primarily focused on the distribution system, the final LCRI has profound implications for treatment plant operations. The rule fundamentally alters the risk calculation for corrosion control.</p>
<p>Key Provisions: The final LCRI mandates the complete replacement of all lead service lines (LSLs) nationwide within a 10-year timeframe. It also lowers the lead action level from 15 micrograms per liter (µg/L) to 10 µg/L, which will trigger corrective actions for more water systems.</p>
<p>Plant Impact on Corrosion Chemistry: The most critical nexus for the treatment plant is the impact of its disinfection strategy on distribution system corrosion. Lead in drinking water is primarily a function of corrosion, where lead from pipes, solder, or fixtures leaches into the water. Water chemistry parameters controlled at the plant—specifically pH, alkalinity, disinfectant type, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)—are the primary levers for managing this corrosion. The impending switch to a combined ozone-chloramination process will significantly alter this chemistry.</p>
<p>4.3 The Ozone-Chloramination Nexus: Managing New DBPs and Corrosion Risks</p>
<p>The decision to commission ozone while continuing to use chloramines for residual disinfection creates a complex but manageable set of water quality challenges and opportunities. This combination directly impacts compliance with both the Stage 2 Disinfection Byproducts Rule (DBPR) and the LCRI.</p>
<p>Bromate Formation and Control: The primary DBP of concern with ozonation is bromate (BrO_3^-), a potential human carcinogen with a strict MCL of 10 ppb. Bromate is formed when ozone reacts with naturally occurring bromide ions (Br^−) in the source water. The reaction pathway is complex, involving both molecular ozone and hydroxyl radicals. However, the plant&#x27;s use of chloramination provides a powerful tool for bromate control. Research has demonstrated that the addition of ammonia (NH_3) prior to or concurrently with ozonation can significantly suppress bromate formation. Ammonia acts as a scavenger for key bromine intermediates, particularly hypobromous acid (HOBr) and the bromine radical (Br•), preventing them from being further oxidized to bromate. One recent study showed that monochloramine (NH_2Cl) can quench the bromine radical with a very high reaction rate, reducing bromate formation by up to 77% in low-DOC lake water. A full-scale case study at the Southern Nevada Water Authority successfully used a pretreatment strategy of adding 0.5 mg/L of chlorine followed by 0.1 mg/L of ammonia to control final bromate concentrations to approximately 5 µg/L, well below the MCL, while still achieving target disinfection levels. This demonstrates that a carefully optimized chlorine/ammonia strategy can be a cost-effective solution for bromate control, but it will require rigorous pilot testing at the plant to determine the ideal dose and application point for its specific water quality.</p>
<p>Corrosion Chemistry Shift and Lead Release: The switch from free chlorine (if used seasonally or for primary disinfection) to full-time chloramination, especially post-ozonation, will cause a significant shift in the water&#x27;s oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). Chloramine is a weaker oxidant and has a lower ORP than free chlorine. This is a critical issue for lead control. Over decades of operation with chlorine, a protective layer of lead dioxide (PbO_2), a stable lead (IV) solid, may have formed on the interior surface of lead service lines and lead-containing plumbing components. The lower ORP of chloraminated water can destabilize and dissolve this protective scale, releasing soluble lead (II) into the water and causing a potentially dramatic increase in lead levels at the consumer&#x27;s tap. This is not a theoretical risk; it is the well-documented mechanism behind the lead crisis in Washington, D.C., which occurred after the utility switched from chlorine to chloramines for DBP control. Therefore, the utility cannot simply commission ozone and continue its current CCT program. A comprehensive re-evaluation and optimization of the CCT strategy is mandatory. This will likely involve pilot and bench-scale testing of different corrosion inhibitors (e.g., various orthophosphate or zinc-orthophosphate blends) and adjustments to finished water pH and alkalinity targets to ensure the formation of a stable, passivating scale under the new chloraminated water chemistry.</p>
<p>The impending regulatory changes cannot be addressed in silos. A decision made to solve one problem has direct and significant consequences for others. For example:</p>
<p>The commissioning of ozone is a proactive step for managing taste and odor and providing a barrier against pathogens like Cryptosporidium. However, it introduces a bromate formation risk.</p>
<p>The use of chloramination is an effective strategy to control both bromate and traditional DBPs like trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs). However, it creates a significant lead and copper corrosion risk due to its lower ORP.</p>
<p>To comply with the LCRI, the utility must optimize its Corrosion Control Treatment (CCT), likely by adding a phosphate-based inhibitor, to counteract the corrosive effects of chloramination.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the capital investment in GAC contactors for PFAS compliance will have ancillary benefits. GAC is effective at removing a broad range of organic compounds, which will also reduce the precursors for THMs, HAAs, and potentially some fraction of the precursors that react with ozone to form bromate.</p>
<p>This creates a complex, multi-variable optimization challenge. The ideal operational strategy is one that finds the lowest-cost combination of ozone dose, ammonia dose, CCT inhibitor type and dose, and GAC operational parameters (e.g., empty bed contact time, regeneration frequency) to simultaneously meet all regulatory targets for PFAS, bromate, THMs/HAAs, and lead/copper. Solving this problem effectively is beyond the capability of manual calculations or simple spreadsheets. It requires a dynamic process model, a core component of a Digital Twin, that can simulate these intricate trade-offs and provide operators with data-driven guidance for robust, resilient, and compliant plant operation.</p>
<p>5.0 Pathway to Modernization: A Portfolio of Strategic Options</p>
<p>To navigate the converging challenges of aging infrastructure and new regulations, the plant requires a multi-faceted modernization program that upgrades physical processes, deploys intelligent digital systems, and embeds a strategic asset management framework into its culture. The following portfolio of options is presented not as a menu of standalone projects, but as an integrated system of solutions where each component enhances the value of the others. The physical upgrades create a more robust and efficient plant, while the digital layer provides the intelligence to operate it optimally.</p>
<p>5.1 Part A: Treatment Process and Chemical Management Upgrades</p>
<p>These upgrades target core plant processes to improve reliability, reduce operational expenditures (OPEX), and enhance water quality, laying the groundwork for compliance with future regulations.</p>
<p>Inline Coagulation Control: The conventional practice of relying on periodic manual jar tests to set coagulant and polymer doses is inefficient and reactive to changes in raw water quality. An upgrade to an automated, inline coagulation control system provides significant benefits. This technology uses a suite of online sensors—typically measuring streaming current, turbidity, pH, and sometimes Total Organic Carbon (TOC)—to provide real-time, feed-forward data to a control algorithm. This algorithm continuously adjusts chemical feed pump rates to maintain an optimal dose, responding instantly to fluctuations in raw water quality caused by storm events or seasonal changes. The benefits are well-documented and substantial:</p>
<p>Chemical Cost Savings: By eliminating over-dosing, utilities can reduce coagulant and polymer consumption by 20-30%.</p>
<p>Improved Water Quality: Maintaining a stable, optimized dose results in more consistent settled water turbidity, which reduces the solids loading on the filters, leading to longer filter runs and more stable finished water quality.</p>
<p>Reduced Sludge Production: Lower chemical use directly translates to a reduction in the volume of sludge produced, decreasing disposal costs.</p>
<p>Transitioning to Biologically Active Filtration (BAF): The commissioning of ozone presents a powerful, low-capital opportunity to transform the existing dual-media filters into high-performance biologically active filters. Ozonation is highly effective at breaking down large, complex Natural Organic Matter (NOM) molecules into smaller, more biodegradable compounds, measured as Assimilable Organic Carbon (AOC). This AOC serves as a food source for a diverse community of naturally occurring, harmless bacteria that colonize the filter media (especially GAC), forming a &quot;biologically active&quot; layer. This biomass provides an additional layer of treatment, effectively removing:</p>
<p>Disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors.</p>
<p>Taste and odor compounds.</p>
<p>Residual AOC, which improves the biological stability of the finished water and reduces the potential for bacterial regrowth in the distribution system.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority provides a compelling case study. Their 90 MGD plant uses an ozone-BAF process to treat Rio Grande water. The biofilters achieve approximately one-third of the plant&#x27;s total 60% TOC removal. Critically, they rely on this biological process for organics removal, not the adsorptive capacity of the GAC media. This has allowed them to avoid replacing the GAC every six months—a potential $5 million expense—and instead only top it off every four years for a fraction of the cost. For this plant, converting the existing filters to BAF is a low-cost, high-return upgrade that leverages the investment already being made in ozone.</p>
<p>High-Rate Clarification: As the utility plans for long-term capacity needs or the eventual replacement of its 50-year-old sedimentation basins, high-rate clarification technologies offer significant advantages over conventional sedimentation, primarily a much smaller physical footprint (up to 50 times smaller) and greater resilience to raw water quality swings. The two leading technologies are:</p>
<p>Ballasted Flocculation (e.g., Veolia Actiflo®): This process uses a ballasting agent, typically microsand, to increase the density of the floc particles, causing them to settle much more rapidly. It is exceptionally effective at handling the high and flashy turbidity common in many river sources.</p>
<p>Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF): This process injects microscopic air bubbles into the flocculated water. The bubbles attach to the floc, decreasing their density and causing them to float to the surface, where they are skimmed off. DAF is superior for treating waters with low-density solids, such as those from reservoirs prone to algal blooms.</p>
<p>A critical bench-scale study directly compared the two technologies for treating algal-laden water. While both DAF and ballasted sedimentation achieved similar, excellent removal of algae and cyanobacteria, the ballasted sedimentation process required 33% more coagulant and the addition of polymer and microsand to achieve this result. This suggests that for a given water quality, ballasted flocculation may have higher chemical and operational costs. The optimal choice depends heavily on the primary challenge in the source water: high sediment loads favor ballasted flocculation, while high algae content favors DAF.</p>
<p>On-Site Sodium Hypochlorite Generation (OSHG): This is a critical upgrade for enhancing safety, improving operational reliability, and reducing chemical costs. OSHG systems use electrolysis to produce a dilute (0.8%) sodium hypochlorite solution from common salt, water, and electricity on an as-needed basis. This approach offers numerous advantages over purchasing and storing bulk (12.5-15%) hypochlorite or handling pressurized chlorine gas:</p>
<p>Enhanced Safety: It eliminates the transport of hazardous chemicals to the plant and the risks of a large-scale spill or release. The 0.8% solution is non-hazardous, reducing risks to operators and simplifying regulatory compliance (e.g., OSHA Process Safety Management).</p>
<p>Improved Chemical Quality: Bulk hypochlorite degrades over time, losing strength and forming undesirable byproducts like chlorate and perchlorate. OSHG produces a fresh, stable solution, ensuring a consistent and potent disinfectant dose without these degradation products.</p>
<p>Cost Savings: While there is an initial capital cost, OSHG is significantly cheaper to operate than buying bulk hypochlorite. Most utilities report a payback period of 1 to 3 years on their investment.</p>
<p>Advanced Corrosion Monitoring: To proactively manage the heightened corrosion risks associated with the switch to chloramination and to ensure compliance with the LCRI, the utility must move beyond reactive tap sampling. Advanced corrosion monitoring involves deploying online sensors in the distribution system to get real-time data on corrosion activity. This allows for the adjustment of CCT in response to changing conditions, rather than waiting months for 90th percentile results. Technologies like multi-electrode array sensors can provide near real-time measurements of both general corrosion rates and localized pitting potential. Commercial systems from vendors like Badger Meter (pipe::scan) and Emerson (Rosemount wireless transmitters) can measure key corrosion indicators like ORP, pH, and conductivity, and integrate this data directly into the plant&#x27;s SCADA or digital twin platform for continuous analysis.</p>
<p>5.2 Part B: The Digital Plant - From Data to Decisions</p>
<p>Physical upgrades alone are insufficient. To achieve the next level of efficiency and reliability, the plant must be overlaid with a digital intelligence layer that transforms raw data into actionable insights. This digital plant is built on a foundation of a modernized SCADA system, a digital twin, predictive maintenance technologies, and a strategic asset management framework.</p>
<p>Digital Twins &amp; Predictive Forecasting: A digital twin is the central nervous system of the modernized plant. It is a dynamic, virtual replica of the physical facility that integrates data from disparate sources—real-time SCADA sensor readings, laboratory information management system (LIMS) results, asset management data from the CMMS, and IIoT sensor feeds—with sophisticated hydraulic and process models. This allows the utility to not only see what is happening now, but to predict what will happen next and simulate the impact of different operational decisions.</p>
<p>Commercial Platforms: Several mature, cloud-based platforms are available, each with distinct strengths.</p>
<p>Innovyze (Autodesk) Info360 Plant: A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that excels in operational analytics, creating personalized dashboards, and automating compliance reporting. It uses AWS IoT Greengrass to securely connect to on-premise SCADA and historian databases.</p>
<p>SUEZ Smart O&amp;M (AQUADVANCED): A comprehensive suite of software modules (e.g., AQUADVANCED Plant, Water Networks) that use predictive models to optimize the entire water cycle. It is particularly strong in providing a holistic operational view and has modules for everything from well management to plant process control.</p>
<p>Xylem Vue (powered by GoAigua): A vendor-agnostic platform designed specifically to break down data silos. Its core &quot;Smart Water Engine&quot; integrates and standardizes data from any source (SCADA, GIS, ERP, etc.) into a single unified model, which then powers a portfolio of modular applications for treatment optimization, asset management, and network analysis.</p>
<p>Open-Source Frameworks: For utilities with significant in-house technical expertise, an open-source approach offers maximum flexibility and avoids licensing fees.</p>
<p>EPANET-MSX: This EPA-developed software is the most powerful open-source tool for this application. While its primary design is for distribution system modeling, its Multi-Species eXtension (MSX) provides a robust engine for defining and simulating any system of complex, interacting chemical and biological reactions. This makes it adaptable for modeling treatment processes like DBP formation kinetics, chloramine decay pathways, and the microbial dynamics within a biologically active filter. This approach requires a high level of expertise in process chemistry and programming to build and calibrate the models.</p>
<p>WaterTAP: An open-source Python package developed by the National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI). It is designed for the techno-economic assessment of entire water treatment trains and is highly useful for high-level planning, comparing alternative process configurations, and initial cost modeling.</p>
<p>Predictive Maintenance (PdM) Technologies: PdM represents a shift from fixing equipment based on a schedule (preventive) or after it breaks (reactive) to performing maintenance based on the actual condition of the asset. This is enabled by a suite of technologies:</p>
<p>Condition Monitoring: Deploying low-cost, wireless Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors on critical rotating equipment like pumps, motors, and blowers. These sensors continuously monitor parameters like vibration and temperature, which are leading indicators of mechanical wear and impending failure.</p>
<p>Cloud-Based CMMS: The data from these IIoT sensors must be integrated with a modern, cloud-based Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). This allows the system to automatically generate a work order when a sensor indicates an anomalous condition (e.g., a pump&#x27;s vibration signature exceeds a predefined threshold), ensuring maintenance is performed precisely when needed.</p>
<p>Advanced Inspection: Drones and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) offer a safer and more cost-effective way to inspect large or inaccessible assets. Drones equipped with high-resolution visual and thermal cameras can be used to inspect the vast surfaces of sedimentation basins or tank exteriors for cracks or coating failures. ROVs can perform in-service inspections of clearwells, reservoirs, and other tanks, collecting visual data and sediment depth measurements without the need for costly dewatering, cleaning, and hazardous confined space entry.</p>
<p>AI-Driven Work Order Prioritization: The most advanced PdM systems use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms analyze data from the CMMS, IIoT sensors, and asset criticality scores to intelligently prioritize maintenance work orders. The system can predict which potential failure poses the greatest risk to the plant&#x27;s operation and elevate that work order in the maintenance queue, ensuring that limited resources are always directed to the most critical tasks.</p>
<p>Asset Management Framework: Technology alone is not enough; it must be guided by a strategic framework.</p>
<p>ISO 55001 Alignment: The utility should align its asset management program with the principles of ISO 55001. This international standard provides a framework for establishing a strategic, top-down approach that links asset management activities directly to the organization&#x27;s overall objectives, ensuring that maintenance and capital decisions are driven by business value and risk management, not just engineering considerations.</p>
<p>Risk-Based Prioritization: The cornerstone of modern asset management is a formalized risk-based prioritization process. This involves assessing every critical asset against a risk matrix that plots its Likelihood of Failure (LoF) against its Consequence of Failure (CoF). LoF is determined by factors like age, material, and condition data from inspections and sensors. CoF is determined by the impact a failure would have on public health, regulatory compliance, operational continuity, and cost. The resulting risk score (Risk = LoF \times CoF) provides an objective, data-driven method for ranking assets and prioritizing capital and O&amp;M expenditures, ensuring that limited funds are allocated to mitigate the most significant risks first.</p>
<p>The following table provides a comparative analysis of the leading commercial and open-source digital twin platforms to aid in strategic decision-making.</p>
<p>Table 5.1: Comparative Analysis of Digital Twin Platforms</p>
<p>6.0 Financial Analysis and Funding Strategy</p>
<p>A modernization program of this scale requires a robust financial justification and a clear, viable funding strategy. The proposed investments, while significant, are projected to deliver substantial long-term value by reducing operational costs, mitigating catastrophic risks, and enhancing asset longevity. This section presents a cost-benefit analysis for key initiatives and outlines a strategic approach to securing low-cost federal and state financing.</p>
<p>6.1 Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)</p>
<p>To evaluate the financial viability of the proposed modernization initiatives, a 10-year cost-benefit analysis framework is applied. This analysis moves beyond simple payback calculations to incorporate the time value of money and a fuller spectrum of quantifiable benefits. For each major project, the analysis will calculate the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period.</p>
<p>Quantified Costs: Include initial capital expenditure (CapEx) for equipment and installation, engineering design costs, and projected increases in operational expenditure (OpEx), such as software subscription fees or higher energy use for certain technologies.</p>
<p>Quantified Benefits: Include direct OpEx savings (e.g., reduced chemical, energy, and labor costs), monetized risk reduction (e.g., the cost of an avoided regulatory fine or major emergency repair), and deferred capital spending (e.g., extending the life of an asset through predictive maintenance).</p>
<p>Key Initiative Financial Projections:</p>
<p>On-Site Sodium Hypochlorite Generation (OSHG):</p>
<p>Benefit: Eliminates the purchase of expensive bulk hypochlorite and reduces transportation costs. A single truckload of salt can produce the chlorine equivalent of more than three tanker trucks of bleach.</p>
<p>Financials: While OSHG systems have a significant upfront capital cost, the return on investment is typically rapid. Industry case studies and vendor data indicate a payback period of 1 to 3 years. The IRR for this investment is expected to be very high, often exceeding 25-30%.</p>
<p>Digital Twin and Predictive Maintenance (PdM):</p>
<p>Benefit: This investment generates returns across multiple areas. The digital twin optimizes chemical and energy use, while the PdM program reduces both maintenance costs and the cost of unplanned downtime.</p>
<p>Financials:</p>
<p>Chemical Savings: A digital twin in a Hong Kong drinking water plant demonstrated a 23.3% reduction in alum usage by providing optimal dosing recommendations.</p>
<p>Maintenance Savings: A transition from reactive to predictive maintenance can reduce overall maintenance costs by 20-30% and cut unplanned downtime by 30-40%.</p>
<p>Avoided CapEx: A digital twin implementation by the Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati for real-time control of their collection system resulted in $38 million of avoided capital project work, achieving CSO mitigation for less than $0.01 per gallon.</p>
<p>Payback: The ROI for digital twins is compelling, with typical payback periods estimated between 2 to 3 years.</p>
<p>Biologically Active Filtration (BAF) Conversion:</p>
<p>Benefit: This is a low-capital, high-return project that leverages the existing ozone investment. The primary financial benefit is the dramatic reduction in the need for GAC media replacement.</p>
<p>Financials: The Albuquerque case study is illustrative. By relying on the biological process for organics removal, the utility avoided a $5 million GAC replacement cost every six months, instead opting for a ~$500,000 media top-off every four years. The NPV of this operational change is exceptionally high.</p>
<p>6.2 Federal and State Funding Pathways</p>
<p>Securing low-cost, long-term financing is critical to implementing this program without placing an undue burden on ratepayers. The comprehensive nature of the proposed modernization plan makes it an exceptionally strong candidate for a blended financing strategy led by the EPA&#x27;s WIFIA program.</p>
<p>Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA): This is the ideal primary funding vehicle.</p>
<p>Program Structure: WIFIA is a federal loan program that provides supplemental, low-interest financing for up to 49% of the eligible costs of large-scale water infrastructure projects (projects &gt;$20 million). WIFIA loans offer long repayment terms (up to 35 years after project completion) and flexible repayment schedules.</p>
<p>Project Eligibility: The program is designed for projects of regional or national significance that address key challenges like aging infrastructure, drought mitigation, and regulatory compliance. The proposed modernization program, with its focus on PFAS treatment, infrastructure renewal, and enhanced resilience, aligns perfectly with WIFIA&#x27;s priorities.</p>
<p>Precedent: The WIFIA program has a strong track record of funding large, complex water treatment plant upgrades. Examples include a $726 million loan to Portland, OR, for a new filtration plant to remove Cryptosporidium , a $250 million loan to Springfield, MA, for a comprehensive infrastructure renewal program , and a $131 million loan to Orange County, CA, specifically for PFAS treatment projects.</p>
<p>State Revolving Funds (SRF): The DWSRF and CWSRF, administered by the state environmental agency, are the logical source for the remaining 51% of project funding.</p>
<p>Program Structure: SRF programs provide low-interest loans for a wide variety of drinking water and wastewater projects.</p>
<p>Synergy with WIFIA: SRF loans are commonly used to provide the required local match for a WIFIA loan. The Springfield, MA, project successfully used this combined financing approach.</p>
<p>Targeted Funding: Many states, including California, have established specific supplemental funding pots within their SRF programs to address high-priority issues. The utility should aggressively pursue funding from any available state-level programs for Emerging Contaminants (PFAS) and Lead Service Line Replacement, as these funds often come with principal forgiveness (i.e., grant) components for eligible projects.</p>
<p>Other Funding Sources:</p>
<p>Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) / Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL): These federal initiatives include grants and tax incentives for projects that enhance energy efficiency and promote sustainability. The upgrades to high-efficiency pumps and motors, and the energy optimization enabled by the digital twin, would be strong candidates for this type of funding. The BIL specifically allocated $15 billion nationwide for LSL replacement projects, which can be accessed through the DWSRF.</p>
<p>The recommended financial strategy is to bundle the entire 10-year modernization plan into a single, cohesive program and submit a comprehensive application for a WIFIA loan, while simultaneously applying to the state SRF program for the matching funds.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the financial metrics and maps the proposed initiatives to their most likely funding sources, providing a clear roadmap for the utility&#x27;s finance department.</p>
<p>Table 6.1: Financial Metrics and Funding Eligibility for Modernization Options</p>
<p>7.0 Building the Workforce of the Future</p>
<p>The successful implementation of this modernization plan depends as much on human capital as it does on physical and digital capital. Technology is only a tool; its value is realized by a skilled and motivated workforce. The utility faces a dual workforce challenge common across the industry: a significant portion of its experienced staff is nearing retirement, while the new technologies being deployed require a more advanced and diverse skillset. A proactive, parallel strategy for workforce development is essential for the long-term success of the modernization program.</p>
<p>7.1 Recruitment and Apprenticeships</p>
<p>The water industry is facing a &quot;silver tsunami,&quot; with estimates suggesting that between 30% and 50% of the current skilled workforce is approaching retirement age. This creates a critical experience and skills gap. Simply posting job openings is no longer a sufficient recruitment strategy. The utility must actively build its own talent pipeline.</p>
<p>The most effective strategy for this is to establish a formal Apprenticeship Program. The National Rural Water Association (NRWA) provides an excellent, federally recognized framework that can be adapted for the utility&#x27;s needs. An apprenticeship program is an &quot;earn-while-you-learn&quot; model that combines structured, full-time, on-the-job training with related classroom instruction. A typical program lasts two years and provides a clear pathway for a new recruit to gain the experience and knowledge necessary to become a certified Water Operations Specialist. By partnering with local community colleges or vocational schools for the classroom component and mentoring apprentices with senior operators, the utility can create a sustainable pipeline of qualified, licensed operators who are deeply familiar with the plant&#x27;s specific processes and culture from day one. This approach is one of the most powerful tools for combating workforce shortages and ensuring operational continuity.</p>
<p>7.2 Upskilling and Advanced Training</p>
<p>The new technologies outlined in this report—from ozone and BAF to digital twins and IIoT sensors—require operators and maintenance staff to develop new skills. The training plan must be as deliberate and well-funded as the capital plan itself.</p>
<p>Ozone Safety and Operations: Ozone is a powerful oxidant and a respiratory hazard. All personnel working with or near the new ozone system must receive comprehensive safety training. This training, guided by EPA and OSHA standards, must cover the health hazards of ozone gas, the proper function of ventilation and ozone destruction systems, protocols for responding to a leak, and the correct use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Beyond safety, operators will need process-specific training on how to control the ozone generators, monitor CT (Concentration x Time) values for disinfection credit, and manage the ozone-chloramine interface to control byproducts like bromate.</p>
<p>Digital Literacy and Competency: The transition to a digital plant requires a workforce that is comfortable with digital tools. Training should be provided for all relevant staff on:</p>
<p>Navigating the new SCADA HMI and Digital Twin dashboards.</p>
<p>Using the cloud-based CMMS to manage work orders on mobile tablets.</p>
<p>Interpreting data from new online sensors (e.g., streaming current, real-time corrosion monitors).</p>
<p>Leveraging AWWA Resources: The American Water Works Association offers a vast and cost-effective library of online training resources that are ideal for upskilling the workforce. The AWWA eLearning catalog includes self-paced and instructor-led courses on hundreds of topics. The utility should build a customized training curriculum using these resources, focusing on key areas. Certificate programs in Corrosion Control, Utility Risk &amp; Resilience, and Water Treatment Operator (Levels 1-3) are directly applicable to the modernization plan. These courses, often based on AWWA&#x27;s own manuals of practice, provide a standardized, high-quality, and cost-effective way to deliver Continuing Education Units (CEUs) and ensure staff are trained to the latest industry standards.</p>
<p>7.3 Knowledge Capture and Management</p>
<p>One of the greatest risks of the &quot;silver tsunami&quot; is the loss of decades of invaluable, site-specific institutional knowledge. When a senior operator with 30 years of experience retires, they take with them an intuitive understanding of the plant&#x27;s quirks that is not written down in any manual. Proactively capturing this &quot;tribal knowledge&quot; is a critical risk mitigation strategy.</p>
<p>Traditional methods of writing SOPs are often inadequate. A more powerful approach is to use modern knowledge-capture technologies. The utility should invest in Augmented Reality (AR) headsets (such as the Microsoft HoloLens or RealWear Navigator). A senior operator can wear the headset while performing a complex, non-routine task—for example, calibrating a sensitive online analyzer, troubleshooting a specific pump failure mode, or performing a difficult valve change-out. The headset records the entire procedure from the operator&#x27;s point of view, capturing their actions and verbal explanations.</p>
<p>This video content is then edited into a digital, interactive SOP. A new operator facing the same task in the future can access this video guide on a tablet or even through their own AR headset, receiving step-by-step visual and auditory guidance from the retired expert. This transforms static, text-based manuals into dynamic, on-demand training modules, effectively digitizing and preserving the invaluable experience of the utility&#x27;s most seasoned employees. This creates a living library of best practices that ensures knowledge is transferred to the next generation, dramatically shortening learning curves and reducing the risk of operational errors.</p>
<p>8.0 Phased Implementation Roadmap (10-Year Outlook)</p>
<p>This section outlines a strategic, phased implementation roadmap for the 10-year modernization program. The plan is structured to deliver foundational capabilities first, build upon them with core upgrades, and schedule long-term capital projects based on data-driven priorities. This approach ensures that investments are logical, sequential, and manageable, while delivering tangible benefits at each stage. The first five years are detailed below, with a high-level outlook for the subsequent five years.</p>
<p>8.1 Phased Rollout</p>
<p>Phase 1: Foundational Planning &amp; Quick Wins (Months 0-12)</p>
<p>This initial phase focuses on critical planning, assessment, and the implementation of high-return, low-capital projects that will provide the data and justification needed for the larger program.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Condition Assessment: Immediately contract for a full, plant-wide condition assessment focusing on the high-risk assets identified in Section 3.0. This includes concrete core sampling and half-cell potential testing for basins, filter media analysis and underdrain inspection, and a complete SCADA hardware/software audit.</p>
<p>Pilot Studies: Initiate bench- and pilot-scale studies for critical new processes. This must include a study to optimize the combined ozone-chloramination process for DBP (bromate) control and a parallel study on the conversion of a single filter to a Biologically Active Filter (BAF) to validate performance on the plant&#x27;s specific source water.</p>
<p>Funding Application Development: Assemble a dedicated team (Engineering, Finance, Operations) to develop the comprehensive, bundled application for a WIFIA loan, supported by a parallel application to the state&#x27;s SRF program. This effort should begin immediately, as the application cycle is lengthy.</p>
<p>CMMS and Initial IIoT Deployment: Procure and implement a modern, cloud-based CMMS. Begin the PdM program by deploying wireless vibration and thermal sensors on the 10-15 most critical rotating assets (e.g., high-lift pumps, backwash pumps).</p>
<p>Phase 2: Core Modernization &amp; Digital Foundation (Months 12-36)</p>
<p>With funding secured, this phase focuses on implementing the core process and digital upgrades that will form the backbone of the modernized plant.</p>
<p>SCADA System Overhaul: Execute a full replacement of obsolete SCADA hardware (servers, PLCs) and software. This is the foundational project that enables all subsequent digital initiatives.</p>
<p>Digital Twin Implementation: Procure and begin implementation of the selected Digital Twin platform. This involves connecting the platform to the new SCADA historian and LIMS, and beginning the intensive process of model building and calibration.</p>
<p>On-Site Sodium Hypochlorite Generation (OSHG): Design, construct, and commission the OSHG system. This will immediately improve plant safety and begin generating operational cost savings.</p>
<p>BAF Conversion: Based on successful pilot results, proceed with the full-scale conversion of all filters to BAFs. This involves media replacement/amendment and implementation of optimized backwash procedures developed during piloting.</p>
<p>Phase 3: Long-Term Capital Renewal &amp; Optimization (Months 36-60)</p>
<p>This phase involves executing the larger capital renewal projects, prioritized by the Phase 1 condition assessment, and leveraging the now-mature digital platform for advanced optimization.</p>
<p>PFAS Treatment Project: Begin the design and construction of the GAC or IX contactors required for PFAS compliance, timed to ensure the system is fully operational well ahead of the 2029 EPA deadline.</p>
<p>Advanced CCT Implementation: Design and install the upgraded Corrosion Control Treatment system (e.g., new phosphate feed system and storage) to manage risks from the chloramine chemistry, ensuring LCRI compliance.</p>
<p>Phased Structural Renewal: Begin the first phase of concrete basin and/or filter structure rehabilitation, starting with the assets identified as highest-risk in the condition assessment.</p>
<p>Full PdM Rollout: Expand the IIoT sensor network to cover all critical and semi-critical assets and fully integrate AI-driven work order prioritization into the CMMS.</p>
<p>Outlook for Years 6-10: The second half of the decade will focus on continuing the phased replacement of aging structural and mechanical assets according to the risk-based asset management plan, continuously optimizing plant performance using the digital twin, and adapting to any new regulatory requirements that may emerge.</p>
<p>8.2 Governance and KPIs</p>
<p>Effective project governance and performance tracking are essential for keeping this multi-year program on schedule and on budget.</p>
<p>RACI Matrix: A high-level RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix should be developed to clarify roles and responsibilities for each major initiative. This ensures clear lines of communication and decision-making authority.</p>
<p>Table 8.1: High-Level RACI Matrix for Key Modernization Initiatives</p>
<p>Legend: R = Responsible (Does the work); A = Accountable (Owns the work); C = Consulted (Provides input); I = Informed (Kept up-to-date)</p>
<p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The success of the modernization program will be measured against a dashboard of clear, quantifiable KPIs. These should be tracked monthly and reported quarterly to senior management.</p>
<p>Reliability &amp; Resilience:</p>
<p>Unplanned Downtime of Critical Assets: Target &lt; 2% annually.</p>
<p>Percentage of Critical Assets Covered by PdM Program: Target &gt; 90% by Year 5.</p>
<p>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for Critical Pumps/Motors: Target a 25% increase.</p>
<p>O&amp;M Efficiency:</p>
<p>Chemical Cost per Million Gallons ($/MG): Target 15-20% reduction.</p>
<p>Energy Usage per Million Gallons (kWh/MG): Target 10-15% reduction.</p>
<p>Maintenance Cost Ratio (Preventive/Predictive vs. Reactive): Target &gt; 80:20.</p>
<p>Regulatory Compliance &amp; Water Quality:</p>
<p>Finished Water Turbidity (95th Percentile): Target &lt; 0.10 NTU.</p>
<p>Total Trihalomethanes (TTHM) &amp; Haloacetic Acids (HAA5) LRAA: Target &gt; 50% margin below MCL.</p>
<p>Bromate LRAA: Target &lt; 5 µg/L.</p>
<p>Lead 90th Percentile (Distribution System): Maintain &lt; 10 µg/L.</p>
<p>PFAS Compliance: Meet all MCLs by the 2029 deadline.</p>
<p>By diligently tracking these KPIs, the utility can demonstrate the tangible value of its investments, ensure accountability, and make data-driven adjustments to the implementation plan as needed over the coming decade.</p>

<p>Appendix B: Detailed Vendor Comparison Tables for Digital Twin Platforms</p>
<p>(This appendix would contain the detailed version of Table 5.1, expanded with more specific features and vendor-provided case study links.)</p>
<p>Table B.1: Detailed Comparison of Commercial and Open-Source Digital Twin Platforms</p>
<p>Appendix C: Sample Predictive Maintenance (PM) Schedule for Critical High-Lift Pumps</p>
<p>(This appendix provides a template showing the output of a modern, condition-based CMMS.)</p>
<p>Asset: High-Lift Pump #3 (HLP-03) Criticality Score: 9/10 (High CoF, Moderate LoF) Monitored Parameters: Vibration (x,y,z axes), Bearing Temperature, Motor Winding Temperature, Power Draw (kW)</p>
<p>CMMS-Generated Work Order Summary (Next 90 Days)</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>The schedule includes standard time-based PMs (WO-24-1101, WO-24-1158), which form the baseline of maintenance.</p>
<p>A condition-based alert (WO-24-1135) was triggered by a real-time sensor, prompting an immediate investigation into a specific issue, allowing for early intervention.</p>
<p>AI-driven recommendations (WO-24-1136, WO-24-1192) demonstrate the power of predictive analytics. The system not only detected an anomaly but also diagnosed a probable root cause (misalignment) and forecasted a future failure (bearing), allowing maintenance to be planned proactively during a scheduled outage, avoiding a costly and disruptive emergency repair.</p>
<p>Appendix D: Template Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Combined Ozone–Chloramine Process Monitoring and Control</p>
<p>SOP ID: WTP-OP-027 Title: Ozone-Chloramine Process Monitoring and Control for DBP and Corrosion Management Effective Date: Revision: 0</p>
<p>1.0 Purpose This SOP establishes the procedures for monitoring and controlling the ozonation and chloramination processes to ensure compliance with regulatory limits for disinfection byproducts (DBPs), including Bromate, Trihalomethanes (THMs), and Haloacetic Acids (HAAs), while simultaneously managing corrosion potential in the distribution system in accordance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR).</p>
<p>2.0 Scope This procedure applies to all certified water treatment plant operators responsible for monitoring and adjusting the ozone generation system, the ammonia feed system, and the chlorine feed system.</p>
<p>3.0 Responsibilities</p>
<p>Operator-in-Charge: Responsible for overall process monitoring, making control adjustments based on this SOP, and documenting all actions in the plant log.</p>
<p>SCADA/Control Room Operator: Responsible for monitoring all relevant online analyzers and alarms and notifying the Operator-in-Charge of any deviations from setpoints.</p>
<p>Laboratory Staff: Responsible for performing grab sample analysis as required and entering data into the LIMS.</p>
<p>4.0 Key Process Control Parameters and Setpoints</p>
<p>5.0 Operating Procedure</p>
<p>5.1 Routine Monitoring (Every 4 Hours)</p>
<p>Log into SCADA and review the &quot;Disinfection &amp; CCT&quot; dashboard.</p>
<p>Verify all online analyzer readings (Ammonia, Ozone, Chloramine, pH, Ortho-P) are within the ranges specified in Section 4.0.</p>
<p>Document all readings in the electronic plant log.</p>
<p>Visually inspect all chemical feed pumps and tanks for proper operation and supply levels.</p>
<p>5.2 Process Control for Bromate Management</p>
<p>The primary strategy for bromate control is the application of ammonia prior to ozonation. The target chlorine-to-ammonia-nitrogen (Cl2:N) ratio of 4.5:1 shall be maintained.</p>
<p>The SCADA system will automatically pace the ammonia feed pump based on plant flow and the chlorine dose required to achieve the target ratio.</p>
<p>If weekly lab results show bromate concentrations approaching the 5.0 µg/L action level, the Operator-in-Charge is authorized to increase the ammonia dose to achieve a 4.0:1 ratio, after notifying the Superintendent.</p>
<p>If bromate levels exceed 8.0 µg/L, the ozone dose shall be immediately reduced by 10% and the Superintendent notified. This indicates a significant process upset or change in raw water bromide.</p>
<p>5.3 Process Control for Corrosion Management</p>
<p>The primary strategy for lead and copper corrosion control is maintaining a stable finished water pH and an adequate orthophosphate residual.</p>
<p>The target finished water pH is 9.0. The post-treatment caustic feed system will automatically adjust to maintain this setpoint.</p>
<p>The target orthophosphate residual is 1.0 mg/L. The feed system will be paced based on plant flow to maintain this target.</p>
<p>Any deviation of &gt;0.2 pH units or &gt;0.2 mg/L orthophosphate for more than 1 hour shall be investigated immediately.</p>
<p>6.0 Emergency Procedures</p>
<p>Ozone Leak: If the ambient ozone monitor alarms (&gt;0.1 ppm), evacuate the area immediately and follow the plant&#x27;s Emergency Response Plan for chemical leaks.</p>
<p>Loss of Ammonia Feed: If the ammonia feed system fails, immediately reduce the ozone generator output by 50% to minimize bromate formation and notify the Maintenance Manager.</p>
<p>Loss of Phosphate Feed: If the orthophosphate feed system fails, notify the Superintendent and Distribution System Water Quality Manager immediately.</p>
<p>7.0 Documentation All process adjustments, alarm conditions, and corrective actions taken shall be recorded in the plant&#x27;s electronic logbook with the operator&#x27;s initials, date, and time. Weekly lab results for DBPs shall be reviewed and initialed by the Operations Manager.</p>
