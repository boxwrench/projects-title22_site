        <p>BAYWORK Conference Discussions</p>
<p>Overall Theme: Priming the Pump and Clearing the Flow</p>
<p>The recurring dynamic across utilities is a gap between policy and implementation. Traditional fixes fail because they try to push harder rather than redesigning the system. The path forward is twofold: priming the pump so that circulation starts, and clearing restrictions so that the flow of information and innovation is not blocked. Utilities need both—small interventions that start movement, and structural adjustments that keep it flowing.</p>
<p>Good ideas die in the gap between the boardroom and the pump station. The problem isn’t your people; it’s your system’s plumbing.</p>
<p>Here, “priming and flow” should be understood as applying to innovation, communication, and information—not to staff themselves. The metaphor is about creating conditions where good ideas and practical insights move smoothly through the system.</p>
<p>The Gap</p>
<p>Policy is written at the top—executives responding to regulations, boards, and political pressure. Implementation, however, happens at the bottom—operators facing real water, equipment, and emergencies. Between these levels lies the gap where good intentions often go to die.</p>
<p>Political scientist James Q. Wilson, in his classic book Bureaucracy: What Government Agencies Do and Why They Do It (1989), introduced the concept of street-level bureaucrats. These are the workers whose daily decisions ultimately determine how policy plays out in practice. In water utilities, operators, field crews, lab technicians, and customer service staff embody this role. They innovate constantly out of necessity—adjusting plant operations, inventing repairs in difficult locations, noticing data anomalies, or finding customer service workarounds. Yet these innovations stay local. Utilities rarely have mechanisms to capture or scale them. As a result, valuable knowledge and resilience are lost.</p>
<p>Problem: Innovation remains siloed.
Impact: Organizational learning stalls; morale declines.</p>
<p>Wilson’s Three Levels</p>
<p>Wilson helps us understand the structural dynamics of utilities by showing how incentives and responsibilities differ at each level:</p>
<p>Operators are on the frontlines of implementation. They are closest to the work and the first to spot problems or opportunities.</p>
<p>Managers sit in the middle, responsible for coordination, resource allocation, and translating between field realities and executive priorities.</p>
<p>Executives operate at the top, setting strategy, responding to boards and regulators, and bearing accountability for outcomes.</p>
<p>The gap between these levels explains why policies that make sense in the boardroom often create chaos in the field. Each group is operating under different incentives and pressures, which makes alignment difficult.</p>
<p>Incentives: Rewarded vs. Needed Behaviors</p>
<p>A deeper layer of the gap lies in what each level is actually rewarded for compared to what utilities truly need from them.</p>
<p>Operators
Typically rewarded for:
- Following procedures exactly
- Avoiding anything that could be seen as a regulatory violation
- Not making waves or creating extra work for managers</p>
<p>But what utilities actually need:
- Spotting problems early before they become crises
- Suggesting process improvements
- Adapting creatively to unexpected situations</p>
<p>Managers
Typically rewarded for:
- Keeping their bosses (executives/boards) happy
- Staying within budget
- Avoiding complaints or bad publicity</p>
<p>But what utilities actually need:
- Translating field reality to executives
- Fighting for resources operators need
- Taking calculated risks on improvements</p>
<p>Executives
Typically rewarded for:
- Board and political satisfaction
- Regulatory compliance metrics
- Financial performance</p>
<p>But what utilities actually need:
- Long-term thinking about system resilience
- Investment in innovation and workforce development
- A grounded understanding of operational realities</p>
<p>When Traditional Approaches Fail</p>
<p>When gaps appear, utilities typically reach for familiar solutions. But these approaches do not address the underlying system design.</p>
<p>More training: Improves skills but does not fix structural incentives that discourage initiative.</p>
<p>Better technology: Digitizes broken processes instead of redesigning them.</p>
<p>Stricter oversight: Increases compliance pressure and risk aversion.</p>
<p>The result is frustration on all sides. Operators feel unheard. Managers absorb pressure without leverage. Executives chase compliance metrics while losing touch with operational reality. This creates brain drain, burnout, and recurring failures.</p>
<p>Framing Insight: These fixes try to push water through a blocked line rather than priming the pump and clearing the path.</p>
<p>Priming and Clearing for Success</p>
<p>The alternative is to create conditions where information and innovation circulate freely. This requires both priming and clearing:</p>
<p>Priming: Small interventions that start the flow, such as safe-to-fail pilots or incentives that encourage transparency.</p>
<p>Clearing: Removing restrictions that block circulation, such as rigid hierarchies, misaligned rewards, or digital systems that don’t serve users.</p>
<p>Together, these actions: - Enable information flows so operator insights reach executives.
- Align incentives to reward surfacing problems instead of hiding them.
- Encourage experimentation to adapt to new challenges.
- Use user-centered design so technology helps rather than hinders.
- Focus on outcomes such as resilience and safety rather than compliance checkboxes.</p>
<p>The Deeper Metaphor</p>
<p>The pump and flow analogy reveals deeper truths about organizational change:</p>
<p>You can’t force it. If the pump isn’t primed or the line is blocked, no amount of effort will move water.</p>
<p>Small interventions have big effects. A little priming fluid or clearing a blockage can restore full circulation.</p>
<p>Circulation matters. Innovation and communication must move up and down the system to sustain reliability.</p>
<p>Maintenance matters. Systems that work well today can fail tomorrow if feedback loops and incentives aren’t maintained.</p>
<p>BAYWORK Relevance</p>
<p>These insights connect directly to BAYWORK’s mission:</p>
<p>Improving retention and recruitment by valuing operator contributions.</p>
<p>Shaping training programs around problem-solving and innovation capture.</p>
<p>Preparing for digital readiness through user-centered approaches.</p>
<p>Using the consortium model as a platform for shared innovation, cross-agency pilots, and regional workforce strategies.</p>
