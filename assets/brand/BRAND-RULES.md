## For AI Agents Building This Site

### Name Usage
- **Correct:** "Title 22", "Title22"
- **Never:** "Title Twenty-Two", "T22", "title22" (lowercase)

### Tone
- Technical expertise grounded in practical experience
- Accessible but not dumbed down
- Strategic and systemic thinking
- "Curious water professionals" as the implied audience
- Learning in public - frameworks and thought process matter

### Color Palette (REQUIRED)

```css
:root {
  --ink: #0e103e;      /* Primary text, headings */
  --blue: #2781bb;     /* Links, buttons, accents */
  --water: #aad3f1;    /* Background panels, subtle highlights */
  --paper: #ffffff;    /* Main background */
  --mist: #acb8c6;     /* Borders, dividers, muted elements */
}
```

### Typography
- Use system font stack for body text
- Headings: bold, clean, readable
- No decorative fonts

### Motion Principles
- Smooth and purposeful
- Enhances understanding, doesn't distract
- Scroll-linked animations should feel natural
- Performance matters - don't sacrifice speed for effects

### Links
- Always link back to www.title22.org where relevant
- External links open in new tab
- Internal navigation is seamless

### Visual Style
- "Cell/stained-glass/clipart-ish" illustration style for hero and cards
- Clean, professional layouts
- White space is good
- Blue as the signature accent color

### Content Rules
- California water context (Title 22 refers to CA recycled water regs)
- Practical over theoretical
- Show the work, explain the thinking
